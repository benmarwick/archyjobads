•Any word on this?  Why/when was it deleted from the wiki?
</p>
<ul>
<li>-never saw this one posted anywhere.  weird.</li>
<li>I don't think this was ever posted on the website until now.  It was posted on the SAA website though and they sent a solicitation for applications to my department head.  The original application deadline was in January and then they moved it forward.  Anyway, I'm always a bit suspicious of department quality when a university doesn't advertise well.  I received a request for publications immediately after I applied back in October (?), but haven't heard anything since. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wow, when did they move up the the deadline and where (if anywhere) was this date change advertised?  The university website seems to have conflicting dates within the job listing itself.  Very strange.  Guess I'll cross that one off my to-do list...  [FWIW, there's a VAP there who fits the ad, now I'm interested to see how this one turns out.]</li>
<li>Email stating that I was not selected for an interview.  Bummer.  I like potatoes. (1/18) (x3)</li>
<li>Anyone hear anymore about this yet? I haven't recieved a reject email, but also no other news (02/15)</li>

<p>Assistant Professor of Environmental Remote Sensing
</p>
<p>Environmental Change Initiative
</p>
<p>The Environmental Change Initiative (ECI) (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.eci.brown.edu/">www.eci.brown.edu</a>), Brown University, invites applications for a Brown University tenure-track faculty position in Environmental Remote Sensing. We seek a scholar who uses remotely sensed data to analyze the multiscalar and complex relationships between human societies and the natural environment. Requirements include a Ph.D. in an environmentally-relevant social or natural science, a record of achievement in the use of remotely sensed data in environmental science-focused research demonstrated by peer reviewed publications and/or externally funded research, and a commitment to excellence in graduate and undergraduate teaching. We seek candidates whose research interests and expertise complement and strengthen existing ECI research foci in land change science, biogeochemical processes, and conservation science. The successful candidate should integrate research efforts with environmentally relevant natural and social sciences spanning sociology, ecology, evolutionary biology and geological and climate science and have experience working in an interdisciplinary team. In addition to remotely sensed data, we are interested in candidates who broadly incorporate geospatial technologies in their research. S/he will maintain an active, externally-funded research program and be involved in teaching at both undergraduate and graduate levels. ECI fosters interdisciplinary research and education in the environmental sciences at Brown. The University is making investments in the ECI including new resources for interdisciplinary research, post-doctoral research appointments, graduate education and a cooperative graduate program with the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) at Woods Hole. The candidate will be a core faculty member of the ECI with an appointment in a tenure-granting department such as Sociology, Geological Sciences, or Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Appointment is expected at the Assistant Professor level, although exceptional circumstances would warrant appointment at a higher level. The department appointment will require that the candidate’s qualifications are commensurate with the tenuring department’s standards for a tenured or tenure-track appointment.
</p>
<p>Requirements include a Ph.D. in an environmentally-related discipline, a record of achievement in the use of remotely sensed data in environmental science-focused research, and a commitment to graduate and undergraduate teaching.
</p>
<p>To apply, please submit a letter of interest addressed to Jack Mustard, Search Committee Chair, Environmental Change Initiative, along with a current CV, teaching and research statements, and 3 letters of reference for the Assistant Professor position. Applications should be submitted through Interfolio at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.interfolio.com/apply/12528">www.interfolio.com/apply/12528</a> and must be received by <b>September 6, 2012</b> in order to receive full consideration. For administrative questions regarding this position please contact Bonnie Horta at Bernadette_Horta@brown.edu or (401) 863-3032. Brown University is an EEO/AA employer. Minorities and women are encouraged to apply.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I worked with these folks at Brown and it's a great research department. I think they would welcome an archaeologist in this position who had a really strong handle on remote sensing, vegetation and landform reconstruction, or the like, and linked that with social questions.</li>
<li>Really, letters of rec for wave 1??? Rude.</li>
<li>^ This times a million.</li>
<li>Sorry folks, this is pro forma in plenty of non-anthro disciplines. You may have noticed that this is a non-anthro search. It is a pain, but not unusual for other fields, especially Geography.</li>
<li>Sorry, it shouldn't be pro forma in any discipline. It is an incredible waste of time and energy.</li>
<li>^ Totally agree, <i>especially </i>when using a nightmare system like Interfolio that all the old professors etc who are providing you with references find utterly perplexing. Anyway, does anyone have any news about this?</li>
<li>A series of speakers listed on their web site are almost certainly job talks for this position, so I guess it's game over on that one. No archaeologists, all of the candidates are very run-of-the-mill contemporary land-use/land-cover change people.</li>
<li>Polite rejection letter via Interfolio for those not among the 'final list of candidates' (Jan 03 2013)</li>

<ul>
<li>Is this strictly an anthropology position, or are they actually looking for an archaeologist? </li>
<li>I read it as one of those "subfield open" positions, and applied accordingly. But I haven't contacted the person listed to ask specifically. Applicant beware, I suppose.</li>
<li>On the AAA website it is listed under the category "social/cultural"</li>
<li>My guess is that they are trying to replace their only anthropologist. He specializes in medical/cultural and is of retirement age. Additionally, the AAA job announcement mentions including transcripts (unclear on official or unofficial) while the college's employment listing does not. The AAA description also mentions the ability to contribute to a "Wellness" program as a plus while the college site does not. Archaeologist beware?</li>
<li>Very nice email from search chair, "thanks for the chance to read your application, but no." (3/25).</li>
<li>This one was a bummer, it was precisely the type of school I always hoped to work for. A quick search revealed that they were phone interviewing sociologists back in early March. Classic waste of time.</li>

<li>Cover Letter</li>
<li>Resume/Curriculum Vitae</li>
<li>Contact information for three (3) references</li>
<li>Unofficial Transcript(s) of your highest completed degree</li>
<li>Anyone heard anything on this one? (x 1, 2/4)</li>
<li>I know they were reviewing applications last week because somebody from Mankato googled for me.  Coincidence?  I think not!
<ul>
<li>Just curious--how can you tell when people google for you? ISP search? Academia.edu?</li>
<li>Google Analytics allows you to place a line of code on your site that then logs each visitor, his or her location, ISP, page views, time on site, google search terms, etc.  It is like Academia.edu but more in depth.  I can only tell that they google for me if they visit the site.  I don't have a friend at google that keeps an eye out for me.</li>
<li>Thanks for the info! Very cool...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Received e-mail for a phone interview, proposed for the <i>next day</i>.  Srsly?  Yes, I'm sitting around waiting to talk to someone in Minnesota, I have nothing better to do.  Not impressed, Mankato.  (2/5) (x3)
<ul>
<li>You must be in a better current position than I am, then!  There are few enough jobs out there that when it comes to interviews, if someone says "jump," I say "how high?" ("like" x1)</li>
<li>I am stoked to be interviewing at Mankato.  I hope the cold winters and short turn around scare off everybody else!  Seriously, it was -30 F last week, your car won't start, and snot freezes in your nose.  Stay away!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Received an email requesting to contact my references. (I had a phone interview). (x3)</li>
<li>Received phone call to schedule on-campus interview. (3/5; x2)</li>
<li>Ahhh, the classic Mexico City vs St Louis University matchup! (as Gandalf would say, "hide your IP addresses, you fools!")
<ul>
<li>whatevs.  O como decimos aquí en México: al huevo.</li>
<li>Ha! Nice try. I am "St. Louis" but I don't live there.  TOR proxy rulez.  Thanks for the advice Gandalf...</li>
<li>Anytime. Good luck Frodo! Watch out for huevos.</li>

<li>Personal response from search chair confirming receipt of my application (2/23). Very classy and considerate. x5</li>
<li>Any news? (4/14)</li>
<li>I received a request via email to let the entire department faculty view my application documents (4/7). Like the above note suggests, they were very classy and considerate. The message said they would like to complete the review process by the end of the month.
<ul>
<li>Why, don't we implicitly give the permission to do that when we send our application materials?</li>
<li>I don't know. It certainly would not have bothered me had they just shared my materials, but it was nice they asked.

<p>The Department of Human Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (Leipzig, Germany) is seeking a post-doctoral researcher with a specialization in faunal analysis. We will consider favorably researchers developing novel or interesting methods addressing such faunal topics as, for example: human subsistence, organic artifacts, bone surface modification, bone as fuel for fires, seasonality, and taphonomy. We are not seeking a researcher who primarily specializes in isotopic analysis. Experimental programs are welcome, and the department is prepared to invest in equipment to support a research program. Chronological and spatial overlap with the Department’s current research interests is preferred. However, we will also consider researchers specialized in Upper Paleolithic or LSA assemblages/artifacts who are prepared to start a program of comparison with earlier assemblages. The Max Planck Society is committed to employing physically impaired individuals and to increasing the share of women in areas where they are underrepresented, and therefore expressly encourages applications from such qualified individuals. <b>The application deadline is January 15, 2013.</b> Please send a one page research agenda along with a CV and the names of three references via e-mail to Diana Carstens (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="mailto:carstens@eva.mpg.de">carstens@eva.mpg.de</a>), as well as a hard copy to: Jean-Jacques Hublin Department of Human Evolution Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Deutscher Platz 6 D-04103 Leipzig (Germany)

<ul>
<li>Heard through the grapevine the vast majority of applicants work in Mesoamerica.</li>
<li>Interesting, I have heard that each contingent was vying to bring one of their own in.  It seems that the current faculty is slightly in favor of the SW.  Of course, the search chair has worked in both regions, and that would probably be their ideal choice.  Who knows.</li>
<li>Short list made and on-campus interviews scheduled last week through next week.</li>
<li>Thanks for letting us know. Apparently no one on the wiki page was invited. Good luck to the interviewees.</li>
<li>I heard that they used the Wiki to eliminate candidates, therefore every one here was automatically excluded!  Ha, that's just what I tell myself to feel better about not getting even the slightest interest.  </li>
<li>Impersonal rejection email (3/21).</li>
<li>Offer made a couple weeks ago. Candidate just accepted. Position filled.</li>
<li>Yeah, I just got two emails. The first was impersonaly saying the job was filled.  The second came about 2 hours later saying who the position was offered to.  I never had that happen before.  It goes beyond impersonal to in-your-face territory.</li>
<li>well, can't blame the candidate for that. Im sure he'd rather not have his name sent around to everyone who applied. not sure what you mean about "in-your-face" as the only person affected by that email is the person whose name was sent out. make sure to not drink that wine, it's a tad old.</li>
<li>There was no blame implied to the successful candidate.  I know that person's work and it is good, if not transformative in the region they work in.  By in-your-face I meant it was not information that should have been presented to the other candidates.  There was no need, and I wonder why the school felt it necessary to do so. It is impolite, sort of like your comment about "old wine", which is exactly why I have not posted that person's name here. </li>
<li>This isn't as bad as the awkward rejection letter sent by one of the schools this year, which stated that they hired somebody who "more closely fit the job description."  I had a phone interview with this school for pete's sake.  Why would they interview somebody who didn't closely fit the job description?  I know that's not how they meant it, but it was still easily misinterpreted as "you're unqualified for this position."</li>
<li>My apologies on the old wine comment. I suppose I was tasting sour grapes myself....sigh. Can't wait for next year!!!!</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>No worries!  Too many of us are in the same boat.  Too many to land these types of jobs anyway.  To take the rotten fruit metaphore a step further, I wonder what our shelf-life is after graduation before we become untouchable.  I always thought 3 years, but I had an encouraging email from a different search committee chair saying it took him 6.  Who knows.  Good luck to everybody next year.</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>SCSU is an Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunity employer. The University seeks to enhance the diversity of its faculty and staff. People of color, women and persons with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.
</p>
<p>SCSU representatives will be conducting interviews at the AAA meeting in San Francisco.
</p>
<ul><li>Do you suppose a copy of "official graduate transcripts" is OK for the first round? Those things cost money, dammit.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>I would send unofficial transcripts and say that official transcripts availble upon request. An aside, I have found that the jobs that ask for Letters of Rec and official transcripts up front typically do so to discourage 100s of applications. In some cases, these same jobs had an inside candidate. Might not apply here, but I agree, don't waste you money on transcripts up front, make them request it. They may come back at you and say that you application is not complete, so definitely follow up with an email before the official deadline and ask if your app is complete. Give youself enough time to go through the channels of the officiat transcript process.</li>
<li> disagree with the above post. If they have 100s and they need to reduce the number, why give them another excuse to "circular file" your app?</li>
<li>You might look into using a service like Interfolio if you expect to need a lot of official transcripts. I had an offical transcript sent there and can now send it out for less than half the cost of ordering additional ones from my univeristy. There's an annual fee for Interfolio, so it may still be more expensive, but if you need to send out other confidential documents (like letters of rec uploaded by your references, etc) it can sometimes be worth it.</li>
<li>AAA interview requested- 10/24 (x5)</li>
<li>Mass email AAA interview request - 11/5 (x6)</li>
<li>How many recieved this email? (see bullet point above?)</li>
<li>Perhaps a better question would be, did anyone not get an invite?</li>
<li>(regarding above bullet) I did not receive an interview request, but I emailed the search chair specifically to say I wouldn't be going to the AAAs due to current teaching obligations</li>
<li>^^Did the chair respond to that email? (11/08)</li>
<li>I removed some content here that was not related to the search (about AAA interviews) and posted it in the Discussion section below.</li>
<li>I emailed the dept. chair in response to the AAA interview announcement, since I could not be there. He said their plan is to conduct telephone or Skype interviews with a long list of approximately 10 candidates in December.</li>
<li>Thanks, and thanks for passing that along. Sounds like that pool will come in part from AAA meetings and in part from those who couldn't get there.</li>
<li>It might be worth to mention that the official cut off deadline for this according to their website is December 15. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://www.southernct.edu/employment/Job_Openings/anthropology/">http://www.southernct.edu/employment/Job_Openings/anthropology/</a>

<li>Mass Email - SEARCH CANCELLED (Dec. 21 x 2)</li>

<ul>
<li>100% shoe-in for this one, trust me
<ul>
<li>I second that</li>
<li>can anyone elaborate on that a little? (10/21)</li>
<li>Do they mean there's an inside candidate?</li>
<li>yes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In all seriousness, do not let this deter anyone from submitting an application. As one of these shoe-ins from last year, there are all sorts of things that can (and do) happen during the search process. Also, the internal candidate may get a better offer. If so, the department will have to consider the applicants. Only those who apply will get counted, might as well be among them, right?</li>
<li>right, and we need to make the search competitive to be successful</li>
<li>I concur that there is a likely inside candidate, who is already associated with the CSFA. </li>
<li>reference letters requested 12/06 (x3)</li>
<li>I heard an unconfirmed rumor (gossip) that there were only 18 applications for this job. Seemed unbelievable to me until I looked at the wiki and noticed the comments. </li>
<li>Deleted posting that clearly identified the "inside candidate" (12/17)</li>
<li>there was a posting that clearly identified the "inside candidate"?</li>
<li>I don't know how "clearly" I identified the inside candidate, I just stated they were shortlisted for another job which three other people were also short-listed for... well, okay, I guess if one did any searching it would have become obvious pretty quick.  Not sure why it would matter though, since "inside candidates" for other searches are VERY clearly identified.  Maybe it was the "inside candidate" who erased my post?  Anyway, it seems stupid not to apply for a job just because there is an inside candidate.  Lots can happen and it doesn't take long to write an application like this.  I didn't apply for the job because it's in Texas and I don't like hot, dusty places.</li>
<li>The internal candidate "identified" above is not the internal candidate of whom I was aware. Perhaps there are two. </li>
<li>Or maybe they are just looking to fill another position there.</li>
<li>While I've never posted on this wiki, I often follow it out of couriosity; however, I find the commentary on this post irrelevant and uniformed. For example why would readers care if someone did or did not apply for this position? Save your status updates for FB ("like" x4).</li>
<li>Really?  Is this the only post with commentary that you find irrelevant and uninformed?  And why would anyone care if you find it to be particularly so?  If people feel like making irrelvant or uninformed commentary, which they very often do on quite a few of these job postings, why not ignore it and move on without being condescending. ("like" x 2)</li>
<li>Wait-there's now TWO inside candidates?!</li>
<li>There are always two . . . a master, and an apprentice.</li>
<li>From second-hand info, the short list was made some time ago. (01/18)</li>
<li>Does anyone have any additional insight into what's going on with this position? I wonder if it's time to give up on it.</li>
<li>They are currently conducting interviews...</li>
<li>I just heard (second-hand) that the inside candidate got the job. What a shocker.</li>
<li>In fact, this position was created for the insider. It is such a BS...</li>
<li>Yeah, it sucks.  But it's not like they have a choice to advertise the position. They generally can't hire someone without a legitimate search.  Anyway, this person probably needs a stable job just as badly as any of the rest of us.</li>
<li>'Search legitimacy' seems kind of artificial in many spousal hire situations.</li>
<li>Many of these posts are ridiculous !  The "insider" and person who was given the job offer also intereviewed at Harvard and Michigan, so this person was a legitimate candidate that deserved the job offer. Those of you with sour grapes should quit complaining and get to work!!</li>
<li>Agreed that this sounds like sour grapes, but between two equal candidates, the inside one often has an advantage because the department already knows her or she can preform.  If indeed a position is created for an adjunct or spouse, that insider has a distinct advantage.  In this case the person was clearly well-qualified and an inside candidate (double threat!).  And I don't think our work ethic is directly correlated with being hired, but it certainly helps.</li>

This new faculty member will be expected to develop additional courses in archaeology, providing depth in their regional area of expertise. Among the geographic areas that we would prefer would be an expert in Latin America, North America, or the Middle East.

<li>Anyone hear anything on this one yet?</li>
<li>Nope (1/14)</li>
<li>Followed up on a call made to me (no message though, just number ID) from these folks. I returned their call, leaving a voice mail message of same, but haven't received a response of any kind. I had assumed this was probably a request for prelim interview or more info for my application. That was 2 days ago. What do you make of that?  (1/18) (x1)</li>
<li>Was it even a human voice? Was it live or recorded?</li>
<li>The call placed to me showed the number on my caller ID; The caller from U MI-Dearborn did not leave a voicemail message, they just hung up when I didn't pick up after 4 rings and were routed to my voicemail.  I called the Anthro/Behavioral Dept. back and got the dept. admin.  My call was routed to HER voicemail, as she didn't pick up.  I left the message that I was returning a call that had been placed to ME.  I left an alternative number and reiterated my email.  Still haven't received a response.  (1/20)</li>
<li>I sent an email that apparently went into a black hole (1/19).</li>
<li>I called the dept. this morning to follow up on my own mysterious phone call and talked with the dept. secretary. She told me it was "probably" the chair of the search committee calling, although why he didn't leave a message is unclear. Best to contact him directly? (1/21)</li>
<li>Email from chair of the program, asking me to contact my letter writers for recommendations. (1/21- x5)</li>
<li>Did anyone who applied NOT get asked for letters? It wasn't clear from the e-mail if they had a long-list, or if they were asking almost everybody for letters. </li>
<li>I applied and have not gotten a request for letters (1/22). (x3)</li>
<li>I got the same phone non-message as the person above, but they did reach me a day or two later.  They were calling their prospective long list (or some of it?) to see whether we were still on the market.  I got the same email on 12/21 as listed above, I hope the person with the phone call problem got it too!</li>
<li>I did!  The email apologized for the process taking so long after the position was advertised - and thus, yes, the calls were to establish whether people who made their initial long list were still interested before moving forward with the request for Ltrs of Rec.  He mentioned there had been far more applicants than they had expected (100+) and the committee took some time going over them all. </li>
<li>Request for phone conversation (2/4)</li>

<li>Any word yet?</li>
<li>None here...  It hasn't been long and it's a busy time of the semester, so I'm still hoping...</li>
<li>I wouldn't worry yet, I'm only just getting requests for searches with mid-November deadlines</li>
<li>Request for additional materials (12/17) x10</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>Did anyone not get the request for additional materials?  - Yes, I did NOT receive a request (x4)</li>
<li>Long lists are usually 10-15 people, so of those people being active on the wiki isn't very surprising.  Several other jobs were the same, where 5-8 people got requests.  Believe me, these guys aren't going to want to sort through everyone's reference letters and publications in January.</li>
<li>What is taking this guys so long!!!???!  Has anyone heard ANYTHING?!</li>
<li>Nope. (x6)  Sometimes that means they're not done, sometimes that none of the small number who got a campus interview post here, so this is a rough time for those of us in purgatory...</li>
<li>Heard last week that they were still working on the short list (2/6)</li>
<li>Phone interviews are being scheduled (week of 2/12)</li>
<li>Did the person above (or someone else) get a call/e-mail for an interview, or is this someone who's just familiar with the progress of the search?</li>
<li>Invitation for CAMPUS interview (not phone interview) received 2/12.
<ul><li>That's interesting-- I had a phone interview that week, and I know someone else who did too.  I wonder why they did both?  Anyway, if there's any further news I'd appreciate being put out of my waiting-game misery.  The last jobs of the year are the hardest to let go of...</li></ul>

<li>Futher info for the person who posted above...I did NOT do a phone interview. I received an email requesting a campus interview although the email requested that we speak in person to make the arrangements. It was a brief conversation about the campus interview process.</li>

<li>Request for letters of reference sent directly to referees (09 Nov) x4</li>
<li>I heard from a reliable source they received over 300 applications x2</li>
<li>Request for additional materials (12 Nov) x5</li>
<li>I have also heard over 300 apps. If you haven't heard anything yet, don't worry, I doubt that they are anywhere close to weeding out the applications at this point. Maybe by the end of the week? Was the request for "additional materials" above for letters of reference? Or, did they request something different?</li>
<li>My references were contacted on 9 Nov, and I was contacted by search committee chair for additional materials (pubs, teaching stuff, etc) today (12 Nov). X5</li>
<li>Received rejection email (15 Nov). X11</li>
<li>Got the Sea Bag Drag, kudos to Vermont for being polite enough to send a note. Last year I had an on-campus interview and the university just never got back to me. Rude!</li>
<li>I have received neither a request for more materials nor a rejection email. Any ideas? Are they still weeding through applications? X3</li>
<li>No ideas, but that happened to me with a job last year. It was super frustrating! I still wonder what the heck happened to my application (although as it turned out, I would never have had a chance at the position anyway).</li>
<li>My guess is that they have several piles. One for interview right away (these are probably the favorites for the hire), one for reject right away (these were determined to not be a good fit using whatever criteria), one for "wait to see how the initial interviews go", and finally one for applications that they haven't gotten to yet. EDIT: Maybe they haven't had enough time to notify the 250+ applicants of their rejection yet. If this is true, many of us should expect rejections today.</li>
<li>Still never heard anything on this one....(I presume interviews are scheduled?)(12/3)</li>
<li>I haven't heard any news on interviews. My references were contacted and I also got the request for additional materials.They may have not had a chance to move following the request for additional information. Then the AAA meetings and Thanksgiving were back-to-back and now we are at the end of the semester. I would not be surprised if they wait until January to move again. Of course, that may just be hopeful thinking on my part :-) (x2)</li>
<li>The request for additional materials said they were going to start reviewing them on or around Nov. 30th. That's just five days ago, so there's plenty of time yet.</li>
<li>Request for phone interview (after review of additional materials) (12/10 x6)</li>
<li>Rejection email -- I did not receive a request for additional materials (12/10)</li>
<li>No rejection or request for phone interview (after review of additional materials) (12/11) (x5)</li>
<li>Email saying that short list will be made by Jan. 14.  (12/27)</li>

<li>Anyone have some word on this search and department? I seem to recall numerous listing for this position over the last two or three years. Am I imaging this or have they lost/failed recent searchers or hires?</li>
<li>There was a posting for an interdisciplinary position in Ethnic and Racial Studies last cycle. I applied, and was told they made a hire. I applied for basically every archaeology position advertised last cycle, and I don't see any record of one at UWLAX.</li>
<li>If I remember correctly from a couple of cycles ago, this is a 4/4 position with high research expectations paying at adjunct levels. Plus it is subject to all the chaos of working in a public WI institution (furlough fun days). So I suspect that they have trouble finding and retaining people.</li>
<li>Sorry I am not American, what do you mean by chaos in public WI institution? Why? And what does it mean "Salary at adjunct level", that is lower? Thanks!</li>
<li>Wisconsin public workers, including faculty at public universities, have had to take numerous "furlough" days in the past few years. Furlough is a forced unpaid day where you're not allowed to do anything related to your work -- you can't come to work, you can't do research, you can't communicate with students, etc. The reasons are complex especially if you're outside the U.S., they deal with budget issues and priorities and devaluing of public education and labor. "Adjunct" level pay is considerably lower than tenure-track faculty pay. I can't personally confirm what the reply above says on that.</li>
<li>Thank you for your reply!</li>
<li>Careful on the online system, there's also an open cultural anthro position that I accidentally applied for. As usual, if there's a way to screw up something, I found it.</li>
<li>They advertised for an archaeologist, "Midwest preferred," in the 2010-11 cycle. That person was there for the 2011-12 academic year and left, and is now listed as a lecturer at another university. I don't know why he left or anything else about the department, I just looked at the last few issues of their dept newsletter and an old list of job ads.</li>
<li>And to add to the history/mystery, during the 2009/2010 cycle, they had interviews with several candidates and ended up choosing NONE of them. Don't know why, but no one was exactly what they were looking for.</li>
<li>I heard the guy that was there for only a year and ended up leaving to become a lecturer elsewhere had health problems and that he was ABD. Don't know if these contributed to his going elsewhere, but from what I've seen in the department listings people tend to stay for many years - it doesn't look like one of those "revolving door" departments that can't keep its faculty.</li>
<li>Mass email confirming search has started (8 Nov)</li>
<li>I did not get an email confirming the search has started, but I got an email weeks ago saying they received my application. What does that mean? (x4)</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I got this like most of 138 other applicants. After submission I asked for confirmation becuase the online app system is a little weird. Perhaps they were obligated to answer all if they answered 1.</li></ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>They likely sent out confirmation emails in two waves, this one was just before the deadline, I would not worry.</li>
<li>Contacted for phone interview 11/12; this sounds quite preliminary, they haven't contacted my references or anything.</li>
<li>Phone Interview conducted 11/09. I was informed that finalists from preliminary interviews conducted at AAAs or by phone, will be contacted in December to schedule on-campus interviews sometime after the New Year.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Has anyone been contacted about AAA interviews? I don't see anything to that effect above.</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>The Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Washington College seeks a dynamic and energetic anthropological archaeologist who can teach a wide range of introductory and upper-level courses. Subfield specialization and temporal/geographic are open, although the ability to build on the strengths of our department in experiential learning and the human-environment relationship is strongly preferred. Pending budgetary approval, this tenure-track position at the rank of Assistant Professor begins August 15, 2013. Ph.D. in-hand is required. The successful candidate will mentor undergraduate students and supervise senior theses. Tenure-line faculty are expected to contribute courses to the college-wide first year writing and research program (see <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://wac.washcoll.edu/grw101.php"><b>http://wac.washcoll.edu/grw101.php</b></a>). The successful candidate will have a demonstrated commitment to teaching excellence, show a strong interest in developing a career as a teacher-scholar in a liberal arts institution, and show significant promise as a scholar.
</p>
<p>The rapidly growing anthropology major at Washington College has a strong foundation in student-centered, field-based research and we highly value multidisciplinary teaching. With the goal of strengthening ties with programs such as Environmental Studies, International Studies, and Gender Studies, our ideal candidate will have a broad background in the four fields of anthropology and the interest and ability to teach the following existing courses: Cultures and Environments of the Chesapeake, Sex, Gender and Culture, and Biological Anthropology. The successful candidate will also have the opportunity to develop new courses relating to topics such as museum studies, cultural resource management, origins of inequality, or genocide. The ability to contribute to our summer field schools and research efforts at the Center for Environment and Society (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://ces.washcoll.edu/"><b>http://ces.washcoll.edu/</b></a>) and/or GIS Labs (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://gis.washcoll.edu/"><b> http://gis.washcoll.edu/</b></a>) is strongly desired. Because no single candidate is likely to match all of these desired areas, we are seeking a vibrant anthropologist who can contribute to the diversity of interests found in our anthropology major.
</p>
<p>To apply, please submit electronic copies of a letter of application, curriculum vitae, teaching philosophy, sample course syllabi, graduate transcript, and the names of three references through our online portal Consensus, at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://highereddecisions.com/wcm/current_vacancies.asp"><b> https://highereddecisions.com/wcm/current_vacancies.asp</b></a>.

<li>Applicants: Any word on this one?</li>
<li>Request for AAA interview 10/29 (x7)</li>
<li>After I said that I couldn't make AAAs they said that they would schedule a skype interview <i>if necessary</i> after the AAAs, even though initial request for AAA interview said that inability to meet in SFO would not negatively affect one's chances. Doh! (x1).</li>
<li>Has anybody received an email about a preliminary interview that was sent after 10/29????</li>
<li>FYI - the current anthropology teaching fellow in the department is an archaeologist and is married to one of the current faculty members. Likely a spousal hire?</li>
<li>Doubtful, she does not have a PhD, and based on the courses that they want taught, Seidel is the one that is reituring or at least going to part-retirement.</li>
<li>Maybe...she received her Ph.D. in 2004 (U. Georgia). She seems very integrated into the department, and has taught several of the courses mentioned. I would be very surprised if they did not hire her, but this is just my opinion. No hard feelings -- she seems like an excellent researcher and teacher.</li>
<li>I would suggest withdrawing your application x2, one less person to worry about.</li>
<li>I know of several cases at prominent universities where one spouse has a TT job while the other has been a visiting or adjunct forever. The department's attitude has been, we know the spouse is not going anywhere, so why not just keep them as a Visiting or Adjunct.</li>
<li>I stand corrected on the no PhD comment, I was looking at the OTHER husband and wife couple in that department.</li>
<li>Some departments do not like to make spousal hires. Some spouses do not want to be full time instructors. In other instances, departments cannot make a desired spousal hire until the administration creates a new line, which depends on budgets and not faculty preferences. In this case, seems as though this job could reflect any of these scenarios... So... Hope for the best! +1</li>
<li>Reference Letters requested 11/30 (x2)</li>
<li>I hope whoever was bellyaching about inside candidates, got a Ref. Letter request. (nope)</li>
<li>Campus interview requested 12/21 (interviews scheduled for Feb.) (x2)</li>
<li>Call stating that the job had been offered to &amp; accepted by another candidate...Total bummer -- I enjoyed my campus interview at this school and really wanted to work there.</li>
<li>FYI -- was in fact a spousal hire (Markin + Lampman)</li>

<p>Does it bother anybody else when applying that these forms ask for our "Gender" and then give us the "Male" or "Female" choice?  The people who make up these BS forms obviously didn't take Anthro 101.  C'mon, don't confuse sex and gender, people.  Let's not even start on the race/ethnicity mess.
</p>
<ul><li>I support this comment 100 percent.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Well this year shows just how insignificant getting a AAA interview is. I did not get a single one, but I made the long list on 8 jobs (which I did not find out about until December) and got on two short lists/campus interviews.
</p>
<p><br>
What in the hell is going on with the format of comment bullet points on this page?!  Why do I keep checking the RSS feed only to find that somebody has added 14 bullet points in front of the comments?  Is this a Wikia standard or does it serve a purpose that I do not understand?
</p>
<ul>
<li>No idea.  I fixed a couple of them, but then realized that will just spam everyone with notifications.  Anyone not seeing the crazyness?</li>
<li>Ahh! The bullet points were driving me nuts so I fixed a bunch. (yes I am procrastinating)</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>It makes it tough to see the actual honest updates in the sea of reformatting.  The point of the wiki site is to keep up to date, no?  I am sorry the bullet points drive you nuts, but having to click through a dozen formatting posts to find an update seems like it would drive everybody nuts, not just one person?</li></ul></dd></dl>
<hr>
<p>Do folks generally not apply to community colleges? I have not noticed any posted on this wiki. 
</p>
<ul><li>Thanks for the information (I asked the question above). I am finding that I am inclined to devote more energy to teaching, so I am working on applying for some CC jobs. Most of them desire PhD applicants now. I don't really care about the prestige, although I am finding that my collegues are incredibly judgemental about my applying to these positions. Thanks everyone for the information. </li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>As others indicate below, CC jobs can be a viable, even great, option to explore, particularly if you are more inclined toward teaching. It is true, from what I understand, that such jobs tend to pay better than research U. TT jobs. I think the reason why CC jobs don't often appear on the wiki is that they usually don't follow the same "season" or cycle as TT Research jobs; the process is a bit different and less trackable on the wiki, I think (at least I've noticed that to be the case in other fields). However, if there are CC Archeo. jobs that look good and that you'd like to try to track here, I don't see any reason why you couldn't add them to the list above.--Admin.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>Not sure, I suspect a lot of people are not interested. The Ph.D. is, after all, a research degree and a community college generally leaves little time, facilities, or support to do research. You don't need a Ph.D. to work at a CC (a M.A. will suffice), meaning that you're overqualified. They also offer little prestige, though I find it hard to believe many of us got into archaeology for prestige.
</p>
<p>I have a friend in one, he makes 70K+ plus summer pay (and can expect to top out 120K+ in 15 years), the tenure clock is only three years, is eligible for semester-long sabbaticals every five years, runs a international field school, has modest professional development $, and has a nice pension that allows him to retire at age 55 (if he wants). He teaches the occasional upper division school at the nearby small liberal arts college. Obviously one of the better community colleges out there. In terms of base salary, professional development, the ability to get some research done, etc., it sounds better (to me) than your average "State U. at X City" position. I think it is insane that many of these assistant professor positions are starting people at &lt;50K, regardless of the area of the country.
</p>
<p>I have been an adjunct at a community college.  I was stepping in for the tenured archaeology prof. there, who was on sabbatical.  He regularly led students on study-abroad semesters and was well paid.  He chose to teach more classes to earn more money and not do research, but he could have had a course reduction and done research.  He also had the summers free (if he wanted them) for fieldwork.  Most of the students were in community college to get their grades up and then transfer to a 4-year institution, and so they were serious and hard working.  You probably won't get a 2/2 load and funds for fieldwork (sometimes I wish I was a cultural anthropologist so I could run a field season on enough for a flight, rent, and food!), but it comes down to what you want in life.  Teaching 4/4 is pretty easy when they are the same 4 to 8 courses on a rotation.  I teach 4/4 now as full-time sabbatical replacement, finished a book, articles, grant proposals, and applied for jobs, so it's possible.  I have not noticed many community college postings on HigherEd, the Chronicle, AAA, or SAA job boards, and I wonder if they are hiring their adjuncts.
</p>
<p>Ugh. Whatcom Community College cancels their search as per email today 2/25. I know nobody cares about cc's here but I would have loved that job.
</p>
<p>^^^Some people care about cc jobs here!  Where did you hear about the Whatcom job?  I follow the Chronicle and HigherEdJobs.com fairly carefully and didn't see it listed there.
</p>
<p>The application deadline was early in January and I saw the ad in The Chronicle in December. If you go to their HR website you may still be able to see the ad and if what they say in the email is true, they will reopen the position next year. I got the suspended search infor in an email on Feb 25.
</p>
<hr>
<p>I have noticed a number of jobs not listed, including ones from the University of Mississippi and University of Tulsa, among others. Does anyone else think this suggests that fewer folks are using the wiki, due to the soul-crushing nature of the whole thing? :-)
</p>
<p>I suspect you can take the number of people reported to use the wiki (a little over one hundred) and triple it. There is a tremendous backlog
</p>
<hr>
<p>To anyone discouraged by the reports of pre-deadline interview requests: I've been called for interviews before the official deadline passed and not made the short list, and so have other people I know. I've also been asked for an interview over a month *later* than others on the wiki, and made the short list. So I wouldn't read too much into posts reporting super-early interview requests-- it doesn't mean the committee has already made up their minds, it may just mean the long list is very long, or that a place with a pretty general ad hasn't decided what direction to go in yet.
</p>
<hr>
<p>Is it my imagination, or are there more snail-mail-only applications this year than last? Seems strange-- I would have thought digital would be easier for reviewers (as well as applicants).

</p>
<p>Lots of jobs appear to be opening up now, I guess maybe the myth of the baby boom retirement is starting to become real??
</p>
<p>Which part of the inevitable process of aging and eventual retirement (or death) is mythical?
</p>
<p>In grad school, I was told by older faculty members that many, many positions would be opening in coming years as the ranks of tenured faculty swollen by baby boomers who had entered the academy when it was in a period of expansion began to retire in large numbers. Perhaps it was just meant to comfort, or perhaps that's a widely held assumption. Regardless, the past few years have had, by many estimates, remarkably few new openings. To me, it doesn't seem like a stretch to make a reference like the writer did. Funny thing, hyper-literalism: It's never quite as funny or charming when stated as it seems in the mind.
</p>
<p>1) The post-WWII Boom lasted approximately 20 years. Shouldn't we expect their retirement to span approximately 20 years as well? If we take 1946 to be the start of the Boom, the oldest are just now approaching retirement age.
</p>
<p>2) In this economic climate, some may choose to delay retirement (if permissable).
</p>
<p>3) If the Boomers got in at a time of expansion, mightn't this time of contraction mean that not every retirement results in an advertised vacancy?
</p>
<p>Faculty in my department may have fed me some b.s. along the way (knowingly or otherwise), but they also taught me to think critically.
</p>
<p>Absolutely right on all counts, though my understanding is the baby boom effect was a bit delayed as children born right after WWII would have entered universities after Vietnam, with many of them on the GI Bill. Your points, especially 2 and 3, is what makes something that's a demographic reality in one sense a "myth" in another. As far as being "fed BS but thinking critically," OK.
</p>
<p>The "boom effect" meaning departmental swell? That some Boomers may have entered universities and the job market later than today's "traditional" students/job-seekers, does not change their present age or proximity to retirement.
</p>
<p>No, but they are delaying retirement into their late 60s or even 70. In addition, many universities are not replacing their lines, so it doesn't matter much if they retire or not. With the Baby Boom came a lot of students entering college in large numbers, and hence the need to expand departments. Although there have been mini-booms over the years, many universities are cutting back. Studies showing that anthropology is the worst college major are not helping (and AAA needs to get in front of that and get more public about what this major is good for). BTW, I first heard these rumors in 1993.
</p>
<p>This following post from Stephen Chrisomalis' blog might be of interest: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://glossographia.wordpress.com/2012/09/26/0926-report-2012-edition/">http://glossographia.wordpress.com/2012/09/26/0926-report-2012-edition/</a>. The numbers are for anthropology jobs in general (all sub-disciplines), and only come from AAA postings, but still... food for thought. Would be nice to know the breakdown by sub-discipline.
</p>
<hr>
<p>To our moderator, if such exists: Is there a reason why in this Wiki we do not mark the old jobs as "DEADLINE PASSED"? I think this would give our contents page more transparency and easiness of search. I'll be happy to do this.
Admin here: go ahead!

<p><b>Just a note for people on committees: </b>In case anybody on a committee actually reads this site (which I don't as it seems to always destroy the hope that comes with ignorance), I have a suggestion. Recall  few years back when every school switched to electonic submissions and all asked for letters of rec as part of the initial process? There was such an outcry that the AAA actually posted that that should be avoided. I wish something similar would be done with the excessively complicated and unreliable e-submission procedures some schools are using, such as ASU and Tulane. Ok. Now that I vented, I wonder if it was worth it....
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Question for the board.</b> How many people do you know that received their Ph.D. in 2009 or later, sought tenure track positions, and actually have them now? I'm curious as to what new archaeology graudates are up againt. I personally know of five out out of 27. Three from 2009 and two from 2010.
</p>
<p>I graduated in 2009, landed a tenure track position in 2009.  I have at least three friends who graduated at the same time or slightly after me who also have tenure track positions.  Can't say it was all that easy, though, and I have several more friends who have not been able to get tenure track positions after graduating.

<p><b>(AAA discussion from the Southern Connecticut State job)</b>
This may be a dumb question, but how can interviews be held mid-November when the application materials are due at the end of the month? Secondarily, what is with all the AAA-based 'interviews'? How many graduate students constrained by pittance salaries will choose to attend the AAAs instead or in addition to, the SAAs? This is feeling more like an elitist poll tax than an opportunity for an initial job interview. (x1)
</p>
<p>Job interviews always take place at the AAAs. They are rarely scheduled for the SAAs. If you are on the market, you should go to the AAAs. Good luck!
</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply, although I am still curious about the discrepancy between mid-Nov interviews and end of Nov deadline for materials, if anyone else can clarify. I am completely broke, so I guess I'm SOL this year for any interviews. My department does not advocate archaeologist attendance at the AAAs, so this news is both disheartening and unexpected.
</p>
<p>Totally agree with the above. I'm able to attend AAAs only because of travel funds in my VAP position. I'll say the AAA "interviews" in my experience are more like meat markets: rush them in, ask a few questions, rush them out. I've also had one experience where I was one of THREE interviewees in the little booth with the committee. In two cases, I had phone interview follow-ups after AAA "interviews," and in others, no movement. In short, the AAA interviews seem more like an initial screening than anything else. And not every school shows up at AAAs, and certainly candidates are hired that committees don't meet at AAAs. (This is all, of course, based on my own limited experience. Your results may vary).
</p>
<p>One can always ask for a Skype or phone interview in lieu of AAAs. Can't hurt to ask. Overall, if on the job market and choosing between AAAs and SAAs, choose AAAs. It's not fair, nor is it ideal. Neither is the job market. Good luck. (x2)
</p>
<p>I don't think it's a big deal for people asked for a AAA interview who aren't attending to be given a phone interview instead (at least, it's worked that way for me before). Some departments do relatively few interviews at this level while others do a LOT. It doesn't sound like anyone's references have been contacted here, so I would guess these AAA interviews are more like the initial screening someone mentioned above. I have no inside knowledge of this place, but not attending the AAAs definitely does NOT take you out of the running in general. (x3)
