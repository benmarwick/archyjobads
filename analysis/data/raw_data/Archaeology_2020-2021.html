<p>California State University San Bernardino invites applications from a diverse group of qualified candidates for a tenure track position in the Department of Anthropology specializing in archaeology at the rank of Assistant Professor to begin August 2021.
</p>
<p>The successful applicant will focus on Indigenous archaeology. Preferred qualifications include active engagement with fieldwork in Western North America or nearby regions. We seek expertise that complements our existing department strengths in ceramics, lithics, and human osteology - for example, GIS, faunal analysis, paleoethnobotany, or historical materials analysis. Significant, collaborative projects with descendant communities are also desirable.
</p>
<p>Our BA in Anthropology provides a broad education in the discipline. Faculty research specializations emphasize ethnography, critical social theory, museum studies, osteology, human ecology, and archaeology. Geographical regions of focus include North America, South America, Mesoamerica, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Graduates often go on to postgraduate studies in anthropology and related social sciences, as well as careers in public archaeology, museums, and education. Our MA in Applied Archaeology program is a professionally-oriented program designed to prepare students for middle and upper-level careers in the cultural resource management (CRM) industry. Students in this program are trained to be well-versed in archaeological theory, analytical techniques, and research design, and graduates are competitive for admission to Ph.D. programs.

The Office of Tribal Relations at CSUSB aims to increase enrollment of Native American students, and to promote Native American perspectives across campus. The campus hosts the annual San Manuel Powwow, and coordinates with a Native American Advisory Board through which stakeholders provide input in decision-making that impacts Native American affairs on campus and in the surrounding community. CSUSB has a Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies, through which students can earn a Certificate in Native Nations / Indigenous Peoples Studies and a Certificate in California Indian Languages and Cultures.

<p>-- OFFER MADE AND ACCEPTED
</p>
<p>The Department of Anthropology at Dartmouth College invites applications for a full-time tenure-track appointment specializing in environmental archaeology.  We seek an anthropological archaeologist whose research seeks to reconstruct past Indigenous and traditional systems of ecological knowledge alongside dynamic human-environment interaction.  Candidates with an active program of field and lab-based research  and expertise in paleoenviromental analytic techniques (e.g., paleoethnobotany, archaeozoology, geoarchaeology, aDNA) will be given priority.  Regional specialization is open, but candidates who expand upon rather than duplicate existing department strengths are preferred. The successful qualified candidate will be appointed initially as a Faculty Fellow, a two-year residential postdoctoral appointment. After this two-year period, the position will convert to a regular tenure-track appointment as Assistant Professor. Faculty Fellows are part of a cohort of faculty committed to increasing diversity in their disciplines. We seek candidates who will be engaging and inspiring our students and who will enhance the diversity of courses and other educational experiences in the department.
</p>
<p>Anthropology at Dartmouth is a four-field department with over 100 undergraduate majors and 50 minors. The department is also part of a growing interdisciplinary PhD program, Ecology, Evolution, Environment and Society (EEES), through which we maintain a cohort of graduate students in relevant fields of anthropology, including archaeology.  In addition, the department typically hosts several postdoctoral scholars funded by the Dartmouth Society of Fellows, the Neukom Institute, the McKennan Fund, and a variety of other institutional programs.   Faculty and students in the Department of Anthropology have access to travel and research funding from numerous institutional sources, including the Department's Claire Garber Goodman Fund for Anthropological Research.  Faculty in the department frequently collaborate with colleagues in the Giesel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Departments of Geography, Biological Sciences, and Classics, as well as with many of Dartmouth’s area and topical studies programs, including Environmental Studies; Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; Native American Studies; Middle East Studies; Latin American, Latino, and Carribean Studies; African and African American Studies; and Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages.
</p>
<p>Dartmouth is highly committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive population of students, faculty, and staff. We are especially interested in applicants who are able to work effectively with students, faculty, and staff from all backgrounds, including but not limited to: racial and ethnic minorities, women, individuals who identify with LGBTQ+ communities, individuals with disabilities, individuals from lower income backgrounds, and/or first generation college graduates. Applicants should state in their cover letter how their teaching, research, service, and/or life experiences prepare them to advance Dartmouth’s commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

</h3>
<p>The Department of Anthropology at Bowdoin College invites applications for a tenure-track position in anthropological archaeology at the rank of Assistant Professor to begin July 1, 2021. We seek candidates whose research and teaching focus on historic or prehistoric archaeology.
</p>
<p>We are particularly interested in candidates who focus on topics such as colonialism; transnational cultural encounters; circulation of people and goods; alliances, conflicts, and violence; identities and inequalities; and/or material culture, cultural heritage, and ethics. We seek a colleague who will collaborate with us in a program that integrates the subdisciplines of cultural anthropology and anthropological archaeology. We also encourage applications from candidates whose teaching incorporates decolonizing, experiential, issue-based, and/or digital and computational pedagogies.
</p>
<p>The ideal candidate will have a geographic specialization in the Americas (North, Central, or South America) or the Arctic-North Atlantic region. We also will consider those candidates whose topical specializations align with the specific areas of interest listed above but whose geographic expertise lies in another region of the world.
</p>
<p>Bowdoin is a community that warmly welcomes people of all backgrounds. We encourage applications from candidates committed to the instruction and support of a diverse student population and from those who will enrich and contribute to the College’s multifaceted diversity. In your application materials, please address how your teaching, scholarship, and/or mentoring would support our commitment to diversity and inclusion.
</p>
<p>Bowdoin requires a strong commitment to research and a promise of long-term successful scholarly engagement as well as a dedication to teaching excellence in a liberal arts environment. The College offers opportunities for professional development, a fully-funded, year-long junior sabbatical leave (after three years of teaching and successful reappointment), and regular, generously funded, post-tenure sabbaticals. The teaching load is two courses per semester. The successful candidates will teach courses in their areas of expertise and will contribute to the rotation of core courses for the major in Anthropology (including Introduction to World Prehistory). A Ph.D. in Anthropology is expected by date of appointment.
</p>
<p>We recognize that recruiting and retaining faculty may involve considerations of spouses and domestic partners. To that end, where possible, the College will attempt to accommodate and respond creatively to the needs of partners and spouses of members of the faculty.
</p>
<p>Bowdoin College accepts only electronic submissions. Please submit: 1) a cover letter that details your scholarly research agenda, describes your teaching experience, and explains your potential contribution to a diverse and inclusive learning environment; 2) a curriculum vitae; 3) one article- or chapter-length writing sample (approximately 8000 words); 4) the names and contact information for three references who have agreed to provide letters of recommendation. Candidates should indicate how their research and teaching specializations contribute to the areas under which the search is organized. Review of applications will begin September 12, 2020. We expect to conduct this search remotely in consideration of the health and safety of candidates and the Bowdoin community.
</p>
<p>Founded in 1794 on the Maine coast, Bowdoin is one of the oldest and most selective coeducational, residential liberal arts colleges in the country. Located in Brunswick, a 30-minute drive north of Portland, the College is in an area rich with natural beauty and year-round outdoor activities. Bowdoin’s reputation rests on the excellence of its faculty and students, intimate size, strong sense of community, and commitment to diversity (32.7% students of color, 6% international students and approximately 15% first generation college students). Bowdoin College complies with applicable provisions of federal and state laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination in employment, admission, or access to its educational or extracurricular programs, activities, or facilities based on race, color, ethnicity, ancestry and national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, age, marital status, place of birth, genetic predisposition, veteran status, or against qualified individuals with physical or mental disabilities on the basis of disability, or any other legally protected statuses.

<ul><li>Just a note, someone either posted this or edited it in a misleading way as a job on "Colonialist archaeology of the Americas." Although the archaeology of colonialism is listed, it is not the only topic. PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THE JOB DESCRIPTIONS WHEN POSTING</li></ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul><li>Note: Bowdoin College currently has a Visiting Assistant Professor whose research aligns with this search pretty much exactly. Seems like they have their internal candidate already. </li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>--As their job description goes from specific to general and back again, I estimate they will receive 300 to 350 applications. The fact that they want letters up front is crazy! I was embarassed to ask my recommenders, but did so anyway.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl>
<dd>-thanks for the note.  I'm hella tired of applying for positions where they already have decided to hire their internal candidate.</dd>
<dd>-this doubly pisses me off because they are asking for freaking letters of rec upfront from everyone. The note to letter writers even says they realize this isn't a best practice but they're doing it anyway. Given how few jobs there are and how many applicants they will have they are wasting a collasal amount of time for so many people. Jerks. </dd>
<dd></dd>
</dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p><br></p>
<ul><li>Received email that the search committee completed their initial review, and my application was still under consideration. They also extended the due date for letters of rec to Oct 6 (10/1 x7) </li></ul>
<p><br>
          --Just out of curiosity, I wonder if everyone who applied got this email, and if there was a cut? Did anyone    who applied not receive this?
</p>
<p>-- I received it, but it certainly sounds like the making of a long-long list. Maybe somewhere between 20-30? But that's just a total guess.
</p>
<ul><li>I applied and did not receive this email, so I assume I'm out of the running</li></ul>
<p>--I received this email but a colleague of mine who also applied did not. It appears they did make a cut. 
</p>
<p>-- Just wondering if anyone has heard anything since the Oct 6 long list email? Feels like they should have narrowed down their list by now, but no news here.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I also made the "long long" list but haven't heard back since Oct 1. They gave until Oct 6 to send all recommendation letters, so I'm guessing it should take them 1-2 weeks before making another decision, which should be around now. Fingers crossed.</li>
<li>^ Same</li>
<li>One week later, still no news on this end. Either this dept  is taking its time reviewing this long list of candidates, or the people on that shortlist aren't using this wikia.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>-- 10/28: Received email for preliminary interview (x2)
</p>
<p>Nov 2020: finalist interviews
</p>
<p>Dec 15: Received final email announcing position has been filled
</p>
<ul>
<li>230 total applicants, if anyone is interested. Huge, but I think we all thought it would have been a bigger pool!</li>
<li>Does anyone know if the inside candidate was the one to get the job?<br>
</li>

<p>The Saxo Institute offers a postdoc position in north-west European Neolithic Archaeology
</p>
<p>We are offering a 3½-year postdoc position for a candidate with a PhD in the Neolithic of north-west Europe and with knowledge of Danish (or Swedish or Norwegian). The position is available from 1 January 2021 and is funded by the research project Deep histories of migration: the early Neolithic around the North Sea financed by the Independent Research Fund Denmark (IRFD). In accordance with IRFD guidelines, postdoctoral candidates must have obtained their PhD within the last four years (counted from 1 October 2019) excluding leaves of absence.
</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to uncover the longer-term impact of migration, which includes the relationship between different forms of contact and material culture change. The project will focus on the long-term networks and connections between Denmark, Britain and Ireland and reveal how these connections developed and changed from the start of the Neolithic (c. 4000 BC) over the following centuries up until c. 3300 BC.
</p>
<p>The successful candidate will be part of a small international research group consisting of the PI and two co-PI’s and will be based at the Saxo Institute, University of Copenhagen, under supervision of PI Rune Iversen. The employment includes an extended research stay (16 months) at the University of Central Lancashire (UK) under the supervision of co-PI Vicki Cummings.
</p>
<p>Job description
</p>
<p>The postdoc will focus on data collection throughout years one and two. Year three will be dedicated to analysis and initial results to be presented in a final monograph (write up in year four). The data collection centres on seven selected micro-regions within Denmark, Britain and Ireland including: Northern Jutland, Funen, West Wales, north-western Ireland, central-eastern Ireland, central-western Ireland and south-eastern England. The data collection will focus on two key pieces of evidence: monuments and structured deposits. The main task will be to collect and record the relevant data in a custom-made database and then perform a detailed network analysis coupled to GIS in order to investigate similarities and differences in material culture.
</p>
<p>The selected candidate is expected to contribute substantially to publications in the research group, oral dissemination of results and to the organization of an international conference to be held at the University of Copenhagen.
</p>
<p>Qualification requirements
</p>
<p>In order to be considered for the position, applicants must have research qualifications at least corresponding to what can be achieved as part of a successfully completed PhD and must be able to read Danish in order to carry out the data collection. The ideal candidate will have a background in northern/north-western European Neolithic archaeology. We seek candidates with good interpersonal skills, the ability to organise work independently and to produce state-of-the art research. Experiences with managing large datasets and familiarity with GIS and network analysis is an advantage. Furthermore, good skills in spoken and written English is a prerequisite.
</p>
