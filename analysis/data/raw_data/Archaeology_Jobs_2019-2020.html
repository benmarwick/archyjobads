<p>The University of Texas at Austin invites applications for three faculty positions as part of a cluster hire in the areas of Maya archaeology, environment and religion.  The cluster represents a critical expansion of UT Austin’s long-existing strengths in the interdisciplinary study of Mesoamerica, a major cultural region defined by what is now southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. It will bring to UT Austin three leading researchers in Maya civilization and culture, all using different approaches to address key questions in archaeology, visual culture, history, religion, and environmental change.  With these three new faculty positions we envision the development of a unique intellectual hub bridging work in the sciences and in the humanities. The three positions will be housed within existing departmental structures but will forge new and strong relationships among the Theresa Lozano Long Institute for Latin American Studies (LLILAS), the Departments of Anthropology, Geography and Environment, Religious Studies, and Art and Art History.
</p>
<p>Assistant Professor or a tenured Associate Professor specializing in Geographic Information Science with a focus on remote sensing technologies including LiDAR, and specialties in Mesoamerica, Maya Studies, and Complex Societies. This person will complement existing strengths and growing needs in research and teaching in the areas of Geographic Information Science, remote sensing, complex human-environment relations, and long-term environmental change. Applicants should be quantitative, remote sensing specialists with expertise in LiDAR who will advance understandings of how the spatial dimensions of archaeological features inform the diachronic understanding of complex past societies and environmental interactions as broadly defined. Research agendas may include how new spatial analytical technologies such as LiDAR shape and enhance our understanding and modeling of, for example, ancient land and water use, population dynamics, the human and environmental complex, political ecologies, societal structure, sustainability, spatial justice, and related issues. The successful applicate will contribute to undergraduate and graduate teaching in the Geography, Environmental Science, Sustainability Studies, Anthropology, and/or Urban Studies degree programs. Questions should be directed to Timothy Beach - beacht@austin.utexas.edu.

</h3>
<p>The
University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) has embarked on a focused cluster
hiring plan to recruit top-tier researchers in interdisciplinary areas of knowledge that will advance the study of <b>Social and Environmental Challenges in</b>
<b>Latin America</b>.  Home to some of the largest bioreserves in the world and
some of world’s most important biodiversity hotspots, Latin America’s environments
are undergoing rapid transformation due to climate change, environmental
degradation, and politico-socio-economic transformations across the
region.  These forces are coupled in
complex ways, and understanding the coupled dynamics of society, climate, and
environment in Latin America presents a grand challenge that is fertile ground
for transdisciplinary research.
</p>
<p>To address this challenge, UTSA is recruiting a cohort of
researchers from different disciplines whose research centers on environmental
degradation, climate change, and the associated socioeconomic and political
challenges and transformations in Latin America and the US-Mexico borderlands.
The goal is to foster collaborative and transdisciplinary research to
understand and confront the emerging social and environmental challenges facing
the region.   This targeted cluster hire will build on and
leverage our established research portfolio, propelling our ability to tackle
and solve previously unsolvable problems. Hires are expected to build their own
unique programs of research, as well as to collaborate with other hires in this
cluster and with colleagues in their home department, college, and other
colleges.
</p>
<p>As part of
this cluster, the <b>Department of Anthropology seeks to hire</b> <b>an environmental</b>
<b>archaeologist at the rank of Assistant Professor (tenure track) to start August</b>
<b>2020</b>. We seek a scholar who studies the long-term relationships between past societies,
environmental transformations, and climate change in Latin America (region
open, including US-Mexico borderlands). <b>Areas of specialty could include</b> but
are not limited to bioarchaeology, paleobotany, zooarchaeology, archaeological
chemistry, ancient DNA, geoarchaeology, climate change, remote sensing, and
“big-data” approaches.  We would welcome
a scholar who employs methods that complement those used by current faculty.
This hire would amplify the department’s strengths in New World archaeology and
environmental anthropology.  The ideal candidate also creates transdisciplinary
collaborative synergies with faculty hired as part of this cluster and existing
faculty in UTSA’s Geography, Geosciences, Environmental Science, and Demography
programs, the Center for Archaeological Research and other units.  The
Department has a Ph.D. program emphasizing anthropology’s engagement with
environmental issues. We are looking for candidates who will enhance this focus
and who also will support the four-field emphases of our B.A., M.A., and Ph.D.
programs.
</p>
<p><b>Required</b>
<b>Qualifications</b>:<b> </b>Ph.D. in Anthropology or related field at time of appointment;
theoretically motivated research; an established record of teaching, research,
and service appropriate to the rank of Assistant Professor;
demonstrated interest and
experience in collaborative teaming and/or transdisciplinary research; desire and ability to contribute to graduate and
undergraduate programs and to educate and mentor students from a culturally
diverse urban population.
</p>
<p><b>Preferred</b>
<b>Qualifications</b>:<b> </b>strong potential for securing external funding; commitment to a
four-field approach to teaching and research; ability to complement existing
faculty specializations; active field research program. Preferred candidates
will be able to successfully teach and mentor diverse, underserved students,
including students of color and non-traditional students, and have the ability
to contribute to the university’s commitment to inclusive excellence as a
Hispanic Serving Institution.
</p>
<p><b>Responsibilities</b>
<b>include</b>: teaching basic courses in archaeology and general anthropology,
elective undergraduate courses, methods oriented courses, and core seminars and
topical graduate courses in areas of specialization; research and service in a
program that offers B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees.  
</p>

</p>
<ul><li>a letter of application describing research, teaching, and service accomplishments and goals</li></ul>
<p>that includes a discussion of the role that diversity and inclusion play in an
academic environment

<p><br><b>Tier 2 Canada Resarch Chair (CRC) in Community-Based Archaeology in the Pacific Northwest</b>
</p>
<p>(<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://www.sfu.ca/archaeology/employment/CRC-2020.html">http://www.sfu.ca/archaeology/employment/CRC-2020.html</a>)
</p>
<p>The Department of Archaeology at Simon Fraser University seeks a nominee for a Tier 2 CRC at the level of Assistant or Associate Professor with a focus on community-based archaeological research in the Pacific Northwest. We seek an exceptional scholar whose research program is centred in community-engagement with, and for Indigenous peoples. Applicants must have a proven publication record. Research focus is open, but may include Indigenous archaeology, human-environment interaction, ethnoecology, historical ecology, and Indigenous research ethics. The successful applicant must also demonstrate potential for effective teaching at the undergraduate level, including general archaeology courses.
</p>
<p>This position is contingent upon the applicant receiving a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair. Tier 2 Chairs are intended for exceptional emerging scholars (i.e., candidates must have been an active researcher in their field for fewer than 10 years at the time of nomination). Applicants who are more than 10 years from having earned their highest degree (and where career breaks exist, including maternity leave, extended sick leave, clinical training, etc.) may have their eligibility assessed through the program’s Tier 2 justification process. Please see the CRC website for eligibility details or contact the office for Institutional Strategic Awards.
</p>
<p>The successful applicant will contribute to SFU’s Strategic Research Plan. The CRC will promote the use of collaborative, community-based archaeology and related heritageoriented research for: 1) addressing environmental concerns and creating a sustainable future; 2) understanding our origins; and 3) strengthening civil society by advancing justice, equity and social responsibility. Understanding the past through archaeology and ethnoecology and linking it to the present allows people to reconnect with their cultural heritage and identity, enhance food security, further rights and title, and reawaken traditional governance and stewardship mechanisms to better manage the lands, waters, and socio-environmental systems — all in furtherance of reconciliation.
</p>
<p>This position is subject to the availability of funding and to final approval of the University Board of Governors and the CRC Secretariat. The Canada Research Chair Program sponsorship of this position is for five years and renewable once, after which the universityis responsible. Interested applicants are invited to review the appointment and renewal details of the CRC program.
</p>
<p>SFU recognizes that alternative career paths and/or career interruptions (e.g. maternity leave, leave due to illness) can impact research achievements and commits to ensuring that leaves are taken into careful consideration. Candidates are encouraged to highlight how alternative paths and/or interruptions have impacted them in their application.
</p>
<p>Simon Fraser University is an institution whose strength is based on our shared commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Diversity is an underlying principle of our Strategic Vision, which pledges SFU to “foster a culture of inclusion and mutual respect, celebrating the diversity reflected among its students, faculty, staff, and our community.” SFU is committed to ensuring that no individual is denied access to employment opportunities for reasons unrelated to ability or qualifications. Consistent with this principle, SFU will advance the interests of under-represented members of the work force, specifically Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, racialized persons, and women; embrace gender and sexual diversity; ensure that equal opportunity is afforded to all who seek employment at the University; and treat all employees equitably. Candidates that belong to underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply.
</p>
<p>SFU offers several benefits and services aimed at creating a more inclusive and accessible campus community for faculty, please see the Faculty Relations, Benefits and Service page for more details. SFU is also committed to ensuring that the application and interview process is accessible to all applicants; if you require accommodations or have questions about SFU benefits, services, accommodations policies, or equity considerations please contact the Director of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in Faculty Relations.

<ul><li>Any updates on the anthropology (archaeology focus) position at Towson University?
<ul>
<li>They sent an email out to some grad programs (?) on 1/10, soliciting more applications: "Review of applications will begin next week.  We plan to conduct on-campus interviews in late January/early February 2020."</li>
<li>1/24: Request from the chair of the committee to have three references submit letters by Friday 1/31 (x3)</li>
<li>(This comment disappeared earlier for some reason) 2/7: Has anyone heard about campus visits yet?</li>
<li>(This comment also disappeared earlier) 2/18: I have not heard anything since the request for reference letters.</li>
<li>Emailed search chair to inquire if they were still accepting applications, and response was that campus interviews currently were underway</li>
<li>Thanks for the update. I had called HR and the department administrative assistant and neither of them had any information.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul><li>Not posted here for some reason and the deadline passed (12/31), but adding a place to post updates about the Assistant Professor of and Director of the Archaeology Research Center position at Indiana University East.<b><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"></span></b>
<ul>
<li>(This comment disappeared earlier for some reason) 2/7: They got 49 applications and are planning to bring 5 candidates to campus at some point.</li>

<ul><li>Anyone has news on the Archaeology position at Indiana University (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Assistant%20Professor%20Archaeology&amp;sort=date&amp;start=10&amp;vjk=3c5846e0d9c357b7">https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Assistant%20Professor%20Archaeology&amp;sort=date&amp;start=10&amp;vjk=3c5846e0d9c357b7</a>)? deadline was November 4, 2019.
<ul><li>Request for Skype interview 2/4</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul><li>Any news on the University of Michigan Assistant Professorship and Curatorship at Kelsey Museum in Classical Archaeology (deadline was November 10, 2019)? 
<ul>
<li>(12/31) Any news on this position?</li>
<li>(1/1) Interviews took place in December, and I am told that campus invites will go out in January.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul><li>Just a heads up that someone from Wake Forest (IP 152.17.169.116) just deleted a lot of information under various entries and rolled back a few entries info as well. Can folks who are involved in these searches go through and double-check the info that was erased or changed backward (i.e. campus visits to skype interview).</li></ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul><li>U of IL position?  Although it is not listed here, Univ of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign had posted an archaeologist position on the AAA jobs board on September 18th but it is not showing up on their HR website.  Does anyone know if it was canceled?</li></ul>
<ul><li><ul><li>(10/2) I just checked the UIUC job board and it is still there...</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><ul>
<li>Posted it (10/2)</li>
<li>10/4 The ads got reposted on several job boards shortly after the above post and it was back up on the HR pg as well. All resolved.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul><li>UNLV position is most likely a fake search based on quick deadline and an internal non-tenure line position that was hired last Spring, which was probably also a fake search.
<ul>
<li>Although the deadline is very quick (not clear why), it is not a fake search and neither was last year's.  A Mayan archaeologist left the department and this is a replacement position.  The non-tenure lines are dedicated to the new online degree program and to partly covering for faculty that are in administrative roles.</li>
<li>I agree that it doesn't look good. A Mayan archaeologist left and a Mayan archaeologist that works on the same project was hired as a non-TT last year, plus a short deadline. Probably a good chance that person is getting this job.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p><br>
Wake Forest and UNLV have the most f$#@ed up application system I've ever seen. That was ridiculous. Rant Over.
</p>
<ul>
<li>aww, Wake Forest, too? Damn, I thought I was getting good at spotting them, lol</li>
<li>Agreed about Wake Forest--I applied (or tried to), and I'm not entirely sure I even uploaded the documents the right way. (x2)</li>

Grand Valley State University TT-Position(s?)
</p>
<p>Does anyone know if they are hiring one or two positions? The job description changed while open, saying they received money for a Distinguished position.    --I went ahead and applied and got a request for more materials and Letters of Rec for the <i>original </i>job decription title. Additional info was due Jan. 10.     Anyone have additional info?
