The successful candidate will be expected to maintain an active program of research, service, graduate supervision, and undergraduate and graduate teaching. The candidate should have a Ph.D. in Anthropology, Archaeology or related discipline, although applicants who will have successfully defended the Ph.D. dissertation by the position start date will be considered. The start date for the position will be <b>July 1, 2022</b>.

<p>To instantiate our values of Access, Equity, and Diversity, the UNCW College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) is embarking on our second year of a cluster hire initiative in the areas of Africana Studies, Race, Racial Inequality, and Social Justice. We seek to build a network of researchers, scholars, and artists that will support the ongoing work in which we are engaged and to set a path forward as we grow these areas of critical study into regional and national strengths. The position of Associate Professor/Professor of Criminology within the Department of Sociology and Criminology is part of this initiative.
</p>
<p>The Department of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina Wilmington invites applications for a full-time Lecturer position. This is a renewable, non-tenure track position, starting the 2022-23 academic year, with the possibility of promotion to Senior Lecturer based on experience and outstanding performance and service to the department.
</p>
<p>The Lectureship entails teaching four courses a semester, including our introduction to archaeology, history of anthropological theory capstone, and introductory and upper-level classes in the individual's area of expertise. The topics of such classes might include the anthropology of race &amp; racism, historical archaeology of Africa and the African diaspora, ethnoarchaeology, bioarchaeology of race, colonial and post-colonial research, and/or racial disparities of health from the perspective of medical anthropology. The position also involves some service responsibilities. The application deadline is January 3, 2022.
</p>
<p>Minimum Education and Experience Requirements: Ph.D. in Anthropology at the time of employment.  Candidates should possess research interest in Africa, African-America communities, or among the African diaspora in the U.S., the Caribbean, or other parts of the Americas.  ABD will be considered; however, applicants who are ABD for the terminal degree at time of application must defend by May 2022.
</p>
<p>Preferred Education, Knowledge, Skills &amp; Experience: Preference will be given to anthropological archaeologists; subfield and specialization are open.
</p>
<p>Primary Function of Organizational Unit: The UNCW Department of Anthropology offers a BA degree in Anthropology, a Minor in Anthropology and an Interdisciplinary Minor in Forensic Science and an Interdisciplinary Minor in Medical Humanities. Our program includes an array of courses designed to provide students an overview of the discipline, and a thorough grounding in archaeology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology. Because there is a strong cross-cultural and comparative focus in Anthropology, students are encouraged to develop competence in a foreign language and to broaden their cultural horizons by participating in study abroad programs. Through participation in field studies and laboratory research projects of faculty mentors, undergraduate students have opportunities to engage in "hands-on" research; sharpen analytical skills; and to develop competence in the use of research instruments and  information technology that are essential aspects of the undergraduate experience in anthropology.
</p>
<p>Special Notes to Applicants: Prior to the official appointment to the university, the candidate(s) selected for hire must be able to demonstrate eligibility to teach assigned courses by successfully meeting the credentialing requirements based on official transcripts and other documentation as required.
</p>
<p>Applications will be accepted until 11:59pm EST on 01/03/2022, the posting close date. To apply, please complete the online application process available at https://jobs.uncw.edu/ and attach the following materials as an Adobe PDF document including:

<p>How did that search committee manage to get through (conceivably) dozens of applications by Tuesday when the deadline was only on Saturday? Or have we reached the point where we don't bother acting like we aren't just going to hire the internal candidate?
</p>
<p>--&gt; Yep, I agree. I received a zoom interview request today, but i am all but certain that it is internal. They have an archaeology lecturer on the faculty, and their only other archaeologist was also a lecturer there before becoming TT.

<p>Location:      Quebec
</p>
<p>The Department of Anthropology invites applications for a tenure-track position in Indigenous Archaeology. We welcome applications from candidates who pursue innovative approaches that aim to decolonize the field, including (but not limited to) community-engaged archaeological projects, Indigenous epistemologies, decolonizing methodologies, and archaeological theory and ethics. Ideal applicants would be capable of developing graduate and undergraduate courses in the above-mentioned areas of research, in their regional specializations, and possibly others, such as the archaeology of colonialism, critical museology, heritage, repatriation, and specialist methods courses. Geographical specialization is open, but preference will be given to candidates with an area of specialization in North America (including Greenland) who self-identify as First Nations, Métis, Inuit, or Native American.
</p>
<p>This position is part of a multi-year interdisciplinary initiative designed to meet the Calls to Action of the Provost’s Task Force on Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Education. This includes the target of hiring at least 35 Indigenous tenure-track or tenured professors by 2032, who will bring lived experience and expertise in Indigenous knowledges, methodologies, histories, traditions, languages, or systems of law and governance. The ideal candidate would complement a department strength in collaborative, community archaeology and would enhance our capacity to mentor and train the next generation of archaeologists. Their research and professional profile would demonstrate the potential to contribute to Indigenous curriculum-building and community research partnerships at McGill.
</p>
<p>Appointment is expected to be at the rank of Assistant Professor, but excellent candidates will also be considered at the ranks of Associate or Full Professor. The position start date is August 1, 2022.

<p>Has anyone heard anything yet? -- still have not (11/10) x 2 -- still nothing (11/15) x 2 -- still nothing (11/19) x2
</p>
<p>---&gt; they are probably still reading the hundreds of letters that they requested in the first round 🙄
</p>
<p>So one month later and still nothing. Anyone else heard back? (11/30) nothing x 2 -- (12/3) nothing
</p>
<p>I guess no one on this wiki made their list. No search ever takes two months to go through a first round review. (12/9)..
</p>
<p>I saw they hired someone to fill this position for 1 year in the spring last year. Not sure what it means for the timeline but it does mean they could have an inside hire for this position.      
</p>
<p>To the comment above: If we look at the data from past years, we can see that an internal candidate does not always have the advantage (sometimes, in reality, disadvantage), and even when an internal candidate gets a job - it is more about the candidate's academic/teaching capacity, rather than their internal relationships.             
</p>
<p>ˆˆAgreed.             
</p>
<p>--Logging onto the job application site at Grinnell, now shows the position is "cancelled." No notice sent out to applicants. Bad form.                          
</p>
<p>-- Received an email announcing that the search was cancelled. 2/10 (x2).                           
</p>
<p>Anyone have more info on what happened here? It's frustrating that they asked for letters up front only to cancel the search.                          
</p>
<p>*I heard from outside sources that they hired their lecturer as full time, so maybe they cancelled the search for that reason?

<p>The Department of Anthropology at The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://anth.la.psu.edu/">https://anth.la.psu.edu/</a>) invites applications for a tenure-line position in archaeology starting Fall Semester 2022. We aim to hire at the early career level (Assistant or Associate Professor).
</p>
<p>We seek an outstanding archaeologist whose interests and skills are consistent with the Anthropology Department's integrative, scientific, and quantitative approach to studying human diversity, and its long traditions of sociopolitical, population, ecological, and evolutionary research in archaeology and beyond. Specifically, we are interested in recruiting an archaeologist whose work addresses the emergence, intensification, preservation, and/or consequences of inequality. Given the rapid rise of levels of inequality on a global scale in the last few decades and the important consequences of these differences for human wellbeing, Penn State Anthropology is interested in hiring a scholar whose work is interdisciplinary and/or integrates across anthropology's subfields to investigate inequality through time.
</p>
<p>The Department of Anthropology is especially interested in candidates who, through their research, teaching, and service, will contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community at Penn State. Methodological and geographical areas of expertise are open. We encourage applicants whose work can contribute toward collaborative scholarship within the department and across the university on initiatives focused on inequality, sustainability and human-environmental systems, and human health. A PhD is required at time of appointment.

<p>The University of Maryland’s University Honors program invites applications for four 3-year postdoctoral teaching appointments with the rank of Assistant Clinical Professor. Assistant Clinical Professors participate fully in the life of a thriving, living-learning community. They teach a small, General Education seminar on a topic related to their research, as well as a first-semester experience and capstone course for the program. Primary responsibilities include:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>teaching</b> (avg. 13 credit hours per academic year);</li>
<li>
<b>mentorship and co-curricular activities</b> (e.g., student-facing programming); and</li>
<li>
<b>curriculum and program development</b>, including course design and curriculum assessment.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 9-month salary for Assistant Clinical Professors is $66,963 and carries full benefits. Over the course of their 3-year appointment, each Assistant Clinical Professor teaches Gateway and Vantage Point Seminars. Additionally, each Assistant Clinical Professor joins a team of University of Maryland faculty drawn from different academic disciplines in a thematic “cluster.” In their first year, Assistant Clinical Professors develop a 20-person thematic seminar based on their disciplinary expertise and teach it in years 2 and 3. We seek teacher-scholars who can contribute to <b>one</b> of the following four themes: 
</p>
<p><b>METAMORPHOSES</b>
</p>
<p>How do individuals and entities of all kinds—from people and processes to artifacts and ideas—achieve their full potential, and how is this development affected by their environments? This cluster examines the mechanisms and conditions of natural growth patterns and how these metamorphoses may be enabled or imperiled.
</p>
<p><b>HEALTH MATTERS</b>
</p>
<p>Health, broadly construed, encompasses multiple dimensions of wellbeing, from physical, mental, and emotional to financial, material and social. This cluster investigates the myriad historical and current forces that shape health, the circumstances that threaten it, and the acts of resistance and empowerment that support safety and recovery. 
</p>
<p><b>HERITAGE</b>
</p>
<p>As we chart innovative pathways to the future, does the past matter? And what are our present obligations to it? This cluster investigates the selective mechanics of inheritance, legacy, and patrimony, and interrogates the ways in which we fashion, forsake, and mobilize our histories.
</p>
<p><b>CIVIL BONDS</b>
</p>
<p>In bonds as diverse as covalence and synthesis, societies and collaborations, habits form that make these relationships work. This cluster explores how networks of mutual support and/or governance are sustained through collective behaviors, and how polarization and inequality can cause them to fray.
</p>
<p>Applicants from all disciplines are welcome to apply. Candidates who have experience working in diverse contexts and who can contribute to a climate of diversity and inclusion are most welcome and actively encouraged to identify their experiences and aspirations in these areas. Please consult our website (https://www.universityhonors.umd.edu) for additional information.

<p><b>Application Materials</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Letter of application that explains how your scholarship relates to the chosen theme</li>
<li>Curriculum vitae</li>
<li>Proposal for theme-related seminar, including title, description (2-4 para), and suggested readings, assessments, and/or activities. Upload as Supplemental Doc 1.</li>

<li>List of 3 references (no emails sent from system)</li>

<p>The Department of Anthropology at the University of Central Florida (UCF) is seeking one (1) postdoctoral scholar to be hired as part of a UCF LiDAR and Groundtruthing Project in the Department of Petén, Guatemala. Salary is $38,000 with benefits and an additional $2000 in professional development funds.  This position is expected to start as soon as possible with specific dates to be determined based upon approval and background checks with UCF Human Resources.  This is a 1-year position that may be renewable for a second year.  The selected candidate will work on the UCF main campus at the UCF GIS Research Cluster Laboratory (https://sciences.ucf.edu/anthropology/research/gis-research-cluster-laboratory/). Individuals seeking a remote work environment may be afforded this opportunity at the discretion and approval of immediate supervisors and UCF Human Resources.
</p>
<p>The job duties are accomplished with open-sourced software and minimum hardware requirements that the candidate will need to personally provide for a remote work situation, if approved. UCF's expectation is that an employee will reside in Florida as of the date the employment begins even if a remote work environment is allowed. Individuals from historically excluded groups are strongly encouraged to apply.
</p>
<p>The primary responsibility of the postdoctoral scholar will be processing LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data from Guatemala to identify and draw structures and features that were created and/or modified by humans on the landscape during the Preclassic-Classic Maya periods. Data processing will be done through the use of commercial software ArchMap 10.x, ArcGIS Pro 2.x, or open-source software QGIS 3.x, and Relief Visualization Toolbox 2.x and Google Earth.  The postdoctoral scholar will not have teaching or other duties during the appointment but may mentor students who aid in the processing of the data. For questions, please write Brigitte Kovacevich (brigitte.kovacevich@ucf.edu) or Michael Callaghan (michael.callaghan@ucf.edu).

<p>The Davidson College Department of Anthropology seeks applications for a two-year Visiting Assistant Professor of Anthropology with a focus on historical archaeology. We are especially interested in a candidate whose work centers on heritage conservation and burial grounds of the African diaspora. Successful candidates should have demonstrated excellence in teaching undergraduates and ongoing research activities that could potentially incorporate undergraduate participation. The teaching load is five courses per year. In addition to courses in their area of expertise, the successful candidate will be able to offer an introductory archaeology course and a GIS methods course. Davidson emphasizes interdisciplinarity, so an ability to offer courses counting in other majors, such as Environmental Studies, Africana Studies, or Latin American Studies is a plus. In addition to teaching, the faculty member will mentor undergraduates, direct independent studies, and when practical, serve as a reader on thesis projects.
</p>
<p>Appointment begins July 1, 2022. Candidates must have a PhD in hand by the time of appointment.
</p>
<p>Apply online at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://employment.davidson.edu">https://employment.davidson.edu</a>.
