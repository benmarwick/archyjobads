<p>Welcome to the Archaeology Academic Jobs Wiki for 2022-2023.
</p>
<p>NOTE: Please post only jobs with a <b>2023</b> start date on this page.
</p>
<p>Next year's page: <a href="/wiki/Archaeology_2023-2024" title="Archaeology 2023-2024">Archaeology 2023-2024</a>
</p>
<p>Last year's page: <a href="/wiki/Archaeology_2021-22" title="Archaeology 2021-22">Archaeology 2021-2022</a>
</p>
<p>Please add any information as you find it, simply edit the page and add your info under the job in question. You don't need an account to edit, just press the "Edit" button at the top of the page. (Note, though, that creating an account masks your IP address). Please keep the listed jobs by deadline.
</p>
<p>Don't post the entire text of the ad or the page will become very hard to edit by the end of the academic year.
</p>
<p>This works best when more people use the wiki, so pass along the link to other people who would be interested.
</p>
<p>Use "Sub-heading 1" when adding names of schools to this page (under the appropriate categories below). Please keep jobs posted in order of Application Deadline.
</p>
<p>When you have news on a listing, please update the status (e.g., "INTERVIEWS SCHEDULED," "CAMPUS INTERVIEWS," "OFFER MADE AND ACCEPTED") at the end of the heading as well as your specific note at the bottom after a bullet point. Please date any information added to a post!

<p>The Cornell University Department of Anthropology invites applications for an assistant or associate professor in the archaeology of liberation, its promises, possibilities, intricacies and illusions. We seek an archaeologist whose practice includes engaged, collaborative approaches that seek to contribute to public and descendant community engagement with the past and our collective imagination of a just future. Research interests might include, but are not limited to, archaeologies of exploitation and emancipation, the materiality of colonization and anti-colonial movements, heritage and its contestations, Indigenous survivance and resurgence, archaeological landscapes of violence, racialization, and resistance, and reparative engagements with material collections. Geographical area and technical specialization are open. The department is particularly interested in scholars who embrace its commitment to multimodal, collaborative, and community-based approaches to research and pedagogy.

<p>The Department of Anthropology invites applications for a tenure-track Assistant or Associate Professor with expertise in Great Lakes/Midwest archaeology and archaeological field and lab methods, demonstrated scholarly productivity, and undergraduate teaching experience. Preference will be given to candidates who have directed an archaeological field school or comparable field project, supervised student research in anthropology or a closely related field, and who have expertise in lithic analysis and/or CRM experience. The department especially welcomes applicants with a demonstrated commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion in their teaching and research. Potential synergy with UWM’s vibrant Museum Studies program is also hoped for but not required.
</p>
<p>The successful candidate will be expected to maintain an active research program with evidence of scholarly productivity. This hire is also critical to the department’s ability to offer a regional archaeological field school and the lab courses required of our undergraduate majors and minors, in addition to chairing PhD and MS thesis projects with a Great Lakes/Midwest archaeology focus. The position involves teaching on a 2:2 schedule including courses such as Introduction to Archaeology (ANTH 103), Archaeology of North America (ANTH 308), Lithic Analysis (ANTH 502), Great Lakes Archaeology (ANTH 565), and Archaeological Analysis and Report Preparation (ANTH 566). In addition, the successful candidate will be expected to teach a regional archaeological field school (ANTH 567) every other summer.
</p>
<p>The successful candidate will also serve as faculty liaison between the department and the ARLC and serve on the ARLC’s Internal Advisory Committee. In 2021 the ARLC coordinated over 600 extra-mural research projects with a combined budget value of $2.5 million. The ARLC plays a vital role in providing experiential learning opportunities and serves as an employment pipeline for archaeology and Museum Studies students. The Great Lakes/Midwest faculty liaison position is critical to the sustainable integration of the research, professional training, and revenue-producing roles of the ARLC, which is an integral part of the research, teaching, and degree-granting missions of the Anthropology Department.

<p>Assistant Professor in Art History with a focus on Art and Archaeology of the Ancient/Medieval World (Tenure Track)
</p>
<p>The Department of Art History and PhD Program in Visual Studies at the University of California, Irvine, invite applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor position in the art and archaeology of the ancient and/or medieval world. Area of specialty and exact time period are open within these broad parameters, but the Current faculty have expressed interest in scholars whose research deals with transregional and transcultural problems in the art and archaeology of the following areas: ancient Egypt (including Dynastic, Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt); East Africa (including Nubia, Aksum and medieval Ethiopia); ancient Mesopotamia, Anatolia and the Levant; the Mediterranean in the first millennia BCE/CE; pre-Islamic Central Asia (including Gandhara); the Indian Ocean littoral; and the ancient Americas. We do not expect candidates to have expertise in all periods or areas but are looking for a colleague whose work lies at the intersection of art history and archaeology, who can collaboratively build on the Department’s current faculty and programmatic strengths in the ancient/medieval world (currently ancient Persia, Byzantium, later South Asia, and Islam).
</p>
<p>Candidates whose work contributes to the study of the political and ethical implications of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, empire, and class, as well as the interdisciplinary field of environmental studies, are particularly encouraged to apply and will find theoretical interlocutors both in the Department and in campus programs, such as UCI’s Critical Theory Emphasis.

<p><s>I just tried as well and I am having the same problem.

<p>-thanks for that update, I had the same issue. Would have submitted over the weekend if I knew it was closing last night. Hopefully it will reopen; lesson for me I guess is to stop submitting applications on the last day.

We will begin our review of all applications by the end of business today (5:00 CST on 11/07).  It looks that the review date was mistakenly used as a closing deadline when the position was created in Human Resources, and the HR software timed out the submission portal at 12:01 AM this morning.

<p>he professorship with a decidedly archeology science profile has two main strands: on the one hand, the transmission and development of applied technological-digital methods in building research and the testing and locating of theoretical concepts for innovative concepts for digital research approaches framed through methods in the humanities on the other. That way applied and theoretical concepts are interlaced in teaching and research. The professorship will be part of the institute for “historical foundations” in the department of architecture.
</p>
<p>The prerequisite is a degree in a relevant field (archeology, architecture, art history) with proven qualification in digital methods of building research and/or historic preservation, and an excellent doctorate.

<p>The University of Evansville seeks applications for a non-tenure track, three-year position as Visiting Professor of Anthropology to start August 1, 2023.  The area of specialization is open.  The university’s Department of Archaeology is looking for a generalist anthropologist whose dynamic and amiable personality will make it possible for us build enrollment in our newly created, cross-departmental anthropology major program.  We have been assured that once we reach a certain level of enrollment in the anthropology major, the position will be converted from visiting non-tenure track to assistant tenure-track.
</p>
<p>The new hire will teach two courses, Cultural Anthropology and World Prehistory, both designed for a general audience of students fulfilling a General Education requirement and for students fulfilling their anthropology major or minor requirements.  Beyond these two, the new faculty member will teach our existing anthropology courses and develop upper-level courses touching on three of the four fields of anthropology including physical, linguistic, and socio-cultural anthropology and specialized upper-level courses tailored to the new faculty member’s area of specialization.  We are also hoping for a candidate who can forge connections across campus with other departments that could collaborate in the anthropology program.  A normal teaching load includes 3-4 courses per semester with the expectation faculty will participate in department duties such as recruitment and university-wide duties by serving in faculty governance. 
</p>
<p>The applicant must complete the on-line application at http;//www.evansville.edu/offices/hr/employmentApp.cfm.  Please upload a cover letter, CV, a statement on your teaching philosophy, a statement regarding diversity, equity and inclusion,  and contact information of three references in a single pdf (one complete application package) in the “Upload Resume” section.  Applications will be accepted until January 2, 2023.

<p>Within the department of Arts &amp; Cultures, a position is available for an assistant professor in Museum, Heritage and Restitution Studies. This new position aims to bring together the museum, heritage and conservation approach and the ethical and global aspects of restitution processes, particularly the tensions between the ethics of restitution, the original, historical and contentious ownership of cultural artifacts, decolonization, museum collections, institutional policy, critique and agency towards global social change and practice.
</p>
<p>We are looking for a candidate with a strong background in museum and heritage studies and well acquainted with the fields of conservation, preservation and restoration, material culture and anthropology, who is able to connect through a global perspective the diverse strands of World War II claims, colonial restitution and illicit trade in archaeological artefacts and material culture. The assistant professor has a focus on museum and heritage collections and practices as well as the ethical considerations on the discourses of restitution and their possible implications for the material handling and treatment of object(s), both in conservation and in presentation. The candidate is able to reflect on museum and heritage practices and also contributes to the academic development of the field. You will provide education in a dynamic context with ample opportunities for the development of innovative teaching methods. Your research will be part of the Amsterdam School for Heritage, Memory and Material Culture (AHM).

<p>A Research Assistant is required for twenty four months to join the Riksbankens Jubileumsfond funded subproject ‘<i>The Atlantic North and the Iberian Peninsula: Contacts ~1400/1300–600 BC’</i>. The new Riksbankens Jubileumsfond funded research program (2022-2027), Maritime encounters: a counterpoint to the dominant terrestrial narrative of European prehistory (short title Maritime Encounters), is led by the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The multi-disciplinary research program aims to shed new light on maritime connectivity across Atlantic Europe from the late Neolithic to the Late Bronze Age through four subprojects. Subproject 4, The Atlantic North and the Iberian Peninsula: Contacts ~1400/1300–600 BC, led by Durham University, United Kingdom, investigates maritime connections between Iberia and Scandinavia during the Late Bronze Age through archaeological, anthropological, linguistic and genetic data. We will characterize and date prehistoric mining in southern Iberia through fieldwork at key mining sites. We will model the circulation of metals through ‘fingerprinting’ chemically and isotopically copper ores collected from fieldwork across southern Iberia and metal artefacts from museums. Comparative analyses will also be performed on samples obtained from other regions of Atlantic Europe. We will reconstruct Post-Proto-Indo-European vocabulary through the study of words and Late Bronze Age rock art. We will use aDNA and stable isotope analysis of human samples, jointly with state-of-the-art ocean modelling techniques, to reconstruct human mobility patterns from Iberia to the Atlantic north.

<p>The earliest origins of twisted fibre technology are unknown but secondary evidence such as composite technology, strung beads and eyed needles suggest these lie deep in the Palaeolithic.  Once developed, binding and looping materials likely became rapidly embedded with extensive demands for production. This project will investigate early evidence for use of twisted fibre and associated fibre technologies in the archaeological record and will investigate the social implications of this complex, time consuming manufacturing craft, using a combination of archaeological evidence, ethnographic fieldwork and experimentation.

<p>The project, Dating Murujuga’s Dreaming: Climate, Culture and Chronology is designed to bring innovative science to understanding the age of the extraordinary rock art and stone structures of Murujuga, as well as reconstructing and modelling Holocene voyaging around the Dampier Archipelago.
</p>
<p>In this position, you will study rock varnish from the Dampier Archipelago, to better understand factors contributing to its development and to establish if an absolute age of its formation can be determined. The research focus will depend on the appointee’s background and the two main research themes are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Research Theme 1:</i> To understand the geochemistry of varnish layers and utilise U-series to estimate the age of varnish formation.</li>
<li>
<i>Research Theme 2:</i> Focuses on understanding the microbiome of communities living in and around desert varnish.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also have opportunity to be mentored to further develop your academic career.
</p>
<p>The position requires high-level expertise in either isotopic geochemistry and materials characterisation, or genomic studies of the microbiome and bioinformatics where you will report to co-supervisor Edwards. Applicants with a background in both microbiology and geochemistry would be strongly encouraged to apply.

<p>The McDonald Archaeological Research Institute, University of Cambridge, invites applications for an 18-month Postdoctoral Research Associate in southern African archaeology and Stone Age lithic technology, generously supported by the Pouroulis Foundation. The postholder will be based in Cambridge (UK), although extended research trips to South Africa will be required as part of the role, for which funds are available. The successful applicant is expected to take up the position from 1st April 2023, or as soon as possible thereafter, and will work under the supervision and guidance of Dr. Alastair Key, Professor Marta Lahr, and Professor Paul Lane at Cambridge, and Dr. Paloma de la Peña at Universidad de Granada, Spain.
</p>
<p>The successful candidate will lead a research project during their tenure on Howiesons Poort technologies in southern Africa. There will be two core elements to this research, which, when combined will provide a deeper understanding of its uniqueness relative to other Southern African lithic traditions. The first line of research will utilise a combination of modelling approaches to understand how we define the tradition, while the second will exploit experimental and artefact-based approaches to investigate its technological exceptionality. As part of their work, the successful candidate will spend most of their time in Cambridge (UK), supplemented by extended research visits to South Africa studying archaeological collections and contributing to fieldwork. The successful candidate will be expected to produce two manuscript drafts during their tenure of the fellowship (with the support of the supervisory team) and, if they wish, will have the opportunity to gain teaching experience at the University of Cambridge.
</p>
<p>In line with the project goals, we seek a lithic specialist with experience working on African Stone Age technologies. Applicants must be in possession of a Ph.D. in Archaeology or a closely related discipline and must have experience with the technological analysis of African lithic materials, from the Middle and/or Late Stone Age. They must also demonstrate experience of undertaking independent research leading to at least one peer-reviewed publication. Competence in communicating in English, including the ability to write academic publications and verbally communicate research to academic and lay audiences, is also essential, as is a willingness to travel to southern Africa for extended research visits lasting several months at a time. Previous experience or knowledge relating to the Howiesons Poort technological tradition will be an advantage.

</p>
<p>The EAMENA Project uses satellite imagery and aerial photography to identify and document archaeological sites in the Middle East and North Africa (from Mauretania to Iran), to improve understanding and enhance their future protection and management. The EAMENA team at Durham works with partner teams at the Universities of Leicester and Oxford. The Durham component of the project is focused upon Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, western Iran and the Caucasus. 
</p>
<p>The CLaSS project investigates the relationship between climate fluctuations and the emergence of complex social and political formations over the Holocene. The project has been collecting archaeological settlement data and archaeobotanical data (plant and tree remains) and zooarchaeological data for the entire Fertile Crescent region and combining these with climate simulations derived from General Circulation Models (GCMs). The goal is to investigate the relationship between climate change and social complexity over the long- and short-term.
</p>
<p>The postholder will be responsible for the organisation of existing, and the creation of new, settlement datasets from legacy sources and satellite remote sensing, and their input into the relevant project databases.  The post-holder will also engage in research, including publication writing, project-related administration and other activities supporting the work of EAMENA and CLaSS.

<p>The Department of Archaeology, History, Cultural Studies and Religion invites applications for a 3-year postdoctoral position in the field of geoarchaeology, relating to Pleistocene and early Holocene landscape evolution along the southern coast of South Africa. The position is part of the Centre for Early Sapiens Behaviour (SapienCE), a Center of Excellence (CoE) funded by the Norwegian Research Council. SapienCE is a multidisciplinary CoE that investigates and contextualizes the early emergence of behavioral modernity during the Middle Stone Age (MSA) of southern Africa.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this position is to produce detailed reconstructions of the palaeolandscapes surrounding the MSA sites of Blombos Cave and Klipdrift Shelter, and to understand the evolution of these landscapes over time. The project entails extensive fieldwork in South Africa, with a focus on field mapping and sampling of aeolianites and paleosols, together with laboratory-based sedimentological, pedological and geochronological analyses. The ultimate goal of this project is to produce palaeolandscape models which can be used to: a) aid the archaeological interpretation of these important MSA sites and b) link the detailed (geo)archaeological records from within these sites to other data. This will primarily be palaeoenvironmental data produced by other SapienCE researchers via an understanding of climatically induced landscape evolution.

<p>The Museum of Cultural History (KHM) is seeking competent and highly motivated reserarchers for two positions as Postdoctoral Research Fellow for a period of 3 years starting no later than 1 October 2023. The positions are associated with the CULTcrime research group. The research group's aim is to produce theoretical and applied research to improve management and measures combatting cultural heritage crime.
</p>
<p><b>Postdoctoral fellow 1</b> will strengthen research into cultural heritage crime in Norway and the Nordic countries. Current issues are the effect of the conservation provisions and antiquities legislation, the extent of violations of these, and how cultural heritage crime affects the protection of loose and fixed cultural heritage, and vice versa. The administration of regulations and enforcement of the submission obligation for the discovery of loose cultural relics when metal detectors are used is a current field of research. The research can be management oriented and/or theoretically oriented.
</p>
<p><b>Postdoctoral fellow 2</b> will develop research into actors and networks involved in cultural heritage crime, legislation, preventive measures and their effects, and risk profiles for various groups of objects. It is relevant to focus on the background and motives of actors and offenders as well as on criminal incidents and causal relationships and on the research, administrative, and societal consequences of such crime.
</p>
<p>Postdoctoral fellow 1 will be organizationally associated with the Archaeological Section (AS). Postdoctoral fellow 2 will be organizationally associated with the Section for Ethnography, Numismatics, Classical Archaeology and University History (SENKU). For both positions, the postdoctoral periode is 3 years, included a 10% component of the position which is devoted to administrative duties within heritage management. The main purpose of postdoctoral research fellowships is to qualify researchers for work in higher academic positions. Both positions will contribute to CULTcrime's research and other activities and thus form part of an interdisciplinary and multi-institutional research group representing archaeology, anthropology, investigative journalism, and social science. In addition to conducting research and presenting its results, the postdocs are expected to contribute to joint activities in the research group. Applicants must state which of the positions they are applying for.

<p>he School of History is seeking a highly capable and self-motivated Postdoctoral Research Fellow to work on the 2017 Kathleen Fitzpatrick Australian Laureate Fellowship for research on ‘Rediscovering the Deep Human Past: Global Networks, Future Opportunities’. This project is in its sixth year and has established the Research Centre for Deep History. The Centre is an Australian-based international consortium in partnership with Harvard and Cambridge centres, making a significant impact on global scholarship. The appointee will be located in the School of History within RSSS.
</p>
<p>This project aims to transform the scale and scope of history. Australia’s epic Indigenous narratives will be analysed alongside relevant new scientific evidence, to create new approaches to the history of Greater Australia/Sahul. Fresh periodisations and understandings will reorient this history in its wider global context. Critiquing the evolution of disciplines, especially the world history/prehistory divide and the Cambridge training nexus, we will develop future-oriented transdisciplinary techniques for researching the deep human past, including digital humanities. A key outcome of the project will be a website showcasing these studies.
</p>
<p>The Postdoctoral Research Fellow will develop community relationships, work in the repatriation of cultural materials, follow up and progress community liaison arrangements and workshops, and develop and coordinate thematic National and International Symposia and publications. The Fellow will be required to develop a research program, work with the PhD students and organise new skills programs. Travel is a requirement of the position, as are skills or an interest in developing skills in digital humanities.

<p>The post-doctoral project will be integrated into the OccitAnimaux project (coord. S. Costamagno, A. Gardeisen and A.-M. Moigne) "Les pratiques de boucherie: mieux comprendre les relations entre les humains et les autres animaux dans le passé" (Butchery practices: better understanding the relations between humans and other animals in the past), which aims to federate the community of archaeozoologists in Occitania around this common problem. The post-doctoral project aims to explore butchery practices beyond the mere survival economy, in the framework of a diachronic archaeozoological investigation carried out on two privileged study laboratories in the current territory of Occitania: the Magdalenian and the protohistory, through in particular the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Butchery practices will be studied both in their daily dimension and in particular contexts such as deep decorated caves for the Magdalenian, intentional deposits of carcasses or episodes of war for the protohistory. Research on the ritualized and/or symbolic aspects of butchery practices is little developed in Paleolithic archaeozoology, which has been built up as the specialty in charge of providing information related to the "economic-nutritional" status of the animal. For more recent periods, the ritual nature of certain exceptional butchery practices is not in doubt, but these aspects are rarely questioned in a domestic context and the place of wildlife is relatively little discussed.

<p>The postdoc project is expected to employ an intellectual history perspective on the ideologies and practices that shaped Dutch colonization in the East (e.g., modern-day Indonesia) and/or the West (New Netherlands/ Brazil, Caribbean etc.). Particular attention is devoted to the role of classical (i.e., ancient Greek and Roman) discourses and themes that influenced colonial policy makers and communities in shaping their settlements and their relations with their mother-city and the surrounding communities. The postdoc project takes a broad/conceptual/ critical approach to the influence of classical ideology and texts in (early) modern colonization by the Dutch.

<p><i>Are you a Roman archaeologist passionate about marrying empirical detail to large-scale socioeconomic questions? The Roman Archaeology expertise group at the Radboud Institute for Culture and History is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to work closely with the group's Chair on developing a project on Roman failure. You will collect and analyse archaeological data to investigate what happened when investments did not pay off as expected.</i>
</p>
<p>In this position for two years you will contribute to a larger developing project that aims to take a case study-based approach to investigate the causes of and responses to failure in the Late Republican and Early Imperial Roman world. Failure is here defined as instances when risk caught up with plans. The Roman world was a high-risk environment, but this risk and its consequences were not equally distributed. A focus on failure favours socioeconomic processes of boom and bust at the expense of narratives of smooth growth and success. Overarching questions include whether failure was tied to a particular vision of the future; how failure intersects with precarity and privilege (who could fail; who could bounce back; who was marked as a failure); and whether and when failure triggered increased investment and fuelled growth. 
</p>
<p>As a postdoctoral researcher, you will collect data from published and unpublished excavation reports of Late Republican and Early Imperial Roman sites with evidence of investments that were abandoned, short-lived, or reoriented. These might include settlements, agricultural installations, infrastructure, or crafts and industries. Preference will be given to projects focusing on Roman Italy, but proposals on other areas of the Roman Empire will also be considered. You will build a database cross-referenced with a GIS platform in order to detect chronological, spatial, and organisational patterns, and carry out quantitative and/or qualitative analyses responding to some of the overarching questions as set out above.

<p>The successful candidate will be part of Katharina Rebay-Salisbury’s research group “Prehistoric Identities”. The research group embarks on a new way of identity research that discusses contextual information on equal footing with bioarchaeological data. “Prehistoric Identities” emerge from the interaction between humans, animals, plants, material culture and landscapes. Current research topics are sex and gender, kinship, marriage patterns and genetic inheritance, as well as foodways, mobility, migration and the experience of being foreign. Case studies from Austria and neighbouring countries form the foundation of a contextualization of these themes within European prehistory

<p>This is an amazing opportunity to work with a large interdisciplinary team supporting safeguarding of heritage under strain from climate change and conflict. The Partnership for Heritage and Heritage in the Crossfire teams, funded by the British Council, use a combination of geomorphological and archaeological techniques to identify and quantify environmental and human threads to the Amazigh heritage in the Jebel Nafusa and Tatouine region.
</p>
<p>As the expert on environmental change in semi-arid environments, you will be responsible for mapping and quantification of geomorphological processes related to climate change. This includes substantial autonomy in developing an overarching environmental research strategy for the region, and the design and remote supervision of appropriate smaller-scale research projects for the project’s Libyan and Tunisian trainees.
</p>
<p>You are therefore expected to contribute to in situ training in Tataouine, specifically focussed on geomorphological field methods for climate change assessment. You are also required to carry out geomorphological fieldwork within the Tataouine region to produce GIS-based climate change risk maps, to be integrated with long-term heritage conservation strategies and will be working closely with the intangible heritage team to develop new interdisciplinary approaches to qualitative and quantitative long-term risk assessment for heritage in this semi-arid region.

<p>This postdoc project will be part of the ECONOVO research theme 1: Diversity Dynamics, focused on understanding biodiversity dynamics in novel ecosystems (NEs) past and present. This position is focused on isotopic niche dynamics of selected terrestrial megafauna during the Late Glacial and Early Holocene in Europe and/or Africa. The aim of this project will be first to collate relevant stable isotopic data from the literature and available databases, and then model megafaunal isotopic niche spaces comparatively and in relation to background environmental variables and key markers of ecosystem novelty, as inferred from published proxy records and/or models. The postdoc is expected to lead a systematic compilation of published stable isotope values for relevant terrestrial megafauna and to use existing modelling tools (e.g., rKIN, SIBER, nicheROVER) to assess dietary niche breadth and stability across time and space. Further, dietary niches should then be assessed in relation to the pace and nature of ecosystem novelty during these periods. Finally, the postdoc is expected to contribute ideas and concepts to the project and lead at least two high-quality papers in this research area. It is also expected that the postdoc contributes to the project’s public outreach and teaching, as well as collaborating with other team members, including students, sharing skills, and helping solve problems in her/his area of expertise.

<p>The Cornell Institute of Archaeology and Material Studies (CIAMS) (https://archaeology.cornell.edu/) invites applications for a two-year Hirsch Postdoctoral Associate in Archaeology position, starting in Fall 2023. We invite applications from scholars who have completed the Ph.D. within the last three years with a specialization in archaeology (broadly defined). We especially seek applicants who offer areas of research and teaching that complement the existing CIAMS faculty (see https://archaeology.cornell.edu/faculty). The area of specialization is open, but we are particularly interested in scholars with research interests in the archaeology of the Western Mediterranean and related regions in Europe and/or North Africa within the past three millennia. We are also interested in candidates who can bring new analytical methods to CIAMS, including but not limited to paleoethnobotanical research. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the faculty, we seek scholars whose work addresses issues of broad intellectual significance. The Hirsch Postdoctoral Associate will teach two courses per year, and will deliver at least one public lecture each year (one of which may form part of the CIAMS, Finger Lakes AIA, or NYSAA lecture series). Additionally, the position-holder will be responsible for organizing and moderating the CIAMS brown-bag workshop series during the first year, and for organizing and hosting a thematic speaker series during one semester of the second year. The balance of the Hirsch Postdoctoral Associate’s time is to be devoted to her/his own research. A faculty mentor will be appointed to assist the Hirsch Postdoctoral Associate with their professional development. The Hirsch Postdoctoral Associate is required to be in residence at Cornell during the semesters of her/his tenure, but is free to conduct fieldwork in the summer or during the winter break if desired. The salary for the position meets the NIH minimum commensurate with experience. Materials must be received by April 1, 2023 to receive full consideration. Eligibility: Applicants must have received the Ph.D. degree no earlier than January 1, 2020. Applicants who will complete all requirements for the Ph.D. degree (including filing the dissertation) before appointment in August 2023 are eligible to apply. The completion requirement for the Ph.D. degree will in no circumstances be waived or extended. Teaching: The position-holder is expected to teach four classes during the two years at Cornell, as follows: (1) a lower-level undergraduate course on a broadly-construed topic within his/her specialization; (2) a course on the practice of archaeology (on methods, ethics, etc.); (3) an upper-level course for a mix of undergraduate and graduate students on topics in his/her geographical area; and (4) a course of the applicant’s choosing. The timing and content of offerings will be negotiated after the fellow has accepted the position. Applications: Applications must be submitted through Academic Jobs Online https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/24550. Please submit (1) a letter of application; (2) CV; (3) a statement on the applicant’s contribution to diversity, equity, and inclusion (4) a list of two courses (each with a 100-word description) that you propose to teach at Cornell; (5) a description of a possible theme for a series of 3–4 speakers in the second year; and (6) names and contact information for three references. Letters of reference and additional materials will be solicited for those applicants of the most interest to Cornell. Questions about the position or the application process should be addressed to Search Committee Chair Prof. Caitie Barrett at ceb329@cornell.edu.

<p>What is going on with the University of Arkansas position? Isn't this pretty much the exact same job posting as last year? Was it a failed search and if so, why?
</p>
<p>-They offered it to someone and then negotiations fell apart. They offered it to someone else who wanted a faculty spousal hire and that didn't happen, either. Viola: failed search.
</p>
<p>---I am the chair of the search committee for this position and have inside knowledge of the prior searches.  Two positions were advertised last year.  One was filled and the other was not.    The current search is a different (third) position.  There are close similarities in the language of the posting, which reflects a sustained interest in building a programmatic focus on environmental and public archaeology.  Several of the criteria for prior searches have been changed for this one.  If your work relates to environmental and/or public archaeology, I encourage you to apply. If you have other questions about the search, please feel free to contact me (my info is in the position announcement).  I will answer any questions that I can, as appropriate.  
</p>
<p>People should be asking what is going on with the University of South Carolina search. They had two failed searches last year (one for biological, one for archaeology), and now they've posted a new archaeology position with a completely different specialization. 
</p>
<p>--The USC call for applications sounds too broad to really know what they want. Perhaps they don't know what they want. I didn't apply because it seemed like it'd be a waste of time. 
</p>
<p>Just want to second the complaint under the Berea job post about requiring up-front letters, ESPECIALLY for short-term positions. To any search committee members reading this: Stop asking for LOR upfront. Just stop. You know you aren't reading them all anyway. Wait until you get a long/short list, THEN ask for letters.  
</p>
<p>Interesting jobs cycle, the wiki has <i>far</i> more stuff posted than last year. Most of this is increased general wiki activity + more jobs from outside North America. However, as far as I can tell, this also reflects a slight but real increase in NA asst prof openings relative to the last cycle (and maybe even relative to recent pre-Covid cycles). Not to say things are good, because the market is obviously still brutal.  
</p>
<p>--I've been using this wiki for about five years. The intent of the wiki has never been to be a place to post every single available job; it has always been used as a place for people to get updates on searches (as far as I've seen). There are already websites that do an excellent job of posting academic positions, such as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://archpostgrad.wordpress.com/">https://archpostgrad.wordpress.com/</a> . You are the one adding the jobs that is making it more comprehensive than it has been in previous years. If you go back through some of the websites that aggregate jobs, you will see that there are literally dozens of jobs that were never posted here. In short, the number of positions listed here is NOT a proxy for the job market and should not be understood as such. It's only an indicator of how specific people are using the board. I personally have stopped updating this board this year (unless people specifically request an update) because it is so damn unwieldy.   
</p>
<p>---For what it's worth, I had made my own list last year and was comparing this one against that. So, those to two years should be at least roughly comparable (and why I was not so certain about recent pre-Covid cycles, which I don't have info on other than the Wiki and haven't felt the need to compile past postings from other sites).  2021-22 had a mild surge of ads for searches that were previously cancelled due to Covid, something I assumed would have dried up by now. But that doesn't appear to be the case.
