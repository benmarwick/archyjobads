<p>The Department of Anthropology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas invites applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor position in Archaeology. We are searching for an anthropologically grounded archaeologist with preferably four-field training and background. Applications from scholars specializing in any periods and geographic areas of the Old World are encouraged, but there is a preference for an individual working in southwest Asia and/or eastern Mediterranean with a theoretical emphasis on complex societies. Potential areas of expertise include archaeobotany, environmental archaeology, geoarchaeology, or GIS. We seek a dynamic scholar with an active research program, established fieldwork, and a proven record of scholarly achievement with publications and external funding. The successful candidate is also expected to complement and enhance the present departmental strengths. Candidates should be able to demonstrate a record of excellent teaching, as they will be expected to teach introductory and advanced courses to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as to offer courses in their area of specialization and to facilitate student access to lab and fieldwork.
</p>
<p>QUALIFICATIONS: 
This position requires a Ph.D. degree from a regionally accredited college or university and must be in hand by June 1, 2018.
</p>
<p>SALARY RANGE: 
Salary competitive with those at similarly situated institutions. Position is contingent upon funding.
</p>
<p>APPLICATION DETAILS: 
Submit a letter of interest, a detailed resume listing qualifications and experience, and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of at least three professional references who may be contacted. Applicants should fully describe their qualifications and experience, with specific reference to each of the minimum and preferred qualifications because this is the information on which the initial review of materials will be based.
</p>
<ul><li>Although this position will remain open until filled, review of candidates' materials will begin on <b>November 15, 2017</b> and best consideration will be gained for materials submitted prior to that date. Materials should be addressed to Dr. Levent Atici at Levent.Atici@unlv.edu, Search Committee Chair, and are to be submitted via on-line application at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://hrsearch.unlv.edu">https://hrsearch.unlv.edu</a>.

<ul>
<li>Applicants, be aware that you get one shot with this online application system, so have everything in order before you go through to the end. There is no actual "Submit" button at the end, nor the chance to review your documents and what you entered in the online forms, Instead, the process ends once you fill out the demographic survey. I may have just sunk my chance at this job by submitting an incomplete application as I was having a look at the online system...</li>
<li>I know it's not the fault of the department, but I'll echo the previous post about how crappy the application portal is. My issue pertained to uploading documents - there's no immediate verification within the application system (until you have sumbitted it) whether or not your documents (CL, CV) are uploaded. You can't preview them, either, to triple-check whether tyou uploaded the correct document, if you loaded multiple copies and it has selected the most previous one, if there's now 3 or 4 cover letters uploaded to your application because there is no in-system verification of your selection. It's fine that they provided the line/email for assistance with your application, but one would have hoped that these basic functions would be accessible for the applicant.</li>
<li>To add to this, there are issues with the application system if you're using Google Chrome. I talked to HR because I had trouble uploading my documents, and they said it's better to use Firefox.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Interesting that the previous poster was told that it was better to use Firefox.  I talked to someone there this afternoon and when she asked me what I was using and I said Firefox, she told me that it was better to use Google Chrome (that it definitely worked better).  Hmmm...  Anyway, at the end of the process, you can check to see if everything uploaded and then contact HR if it didn't and they will do it manually.  It does seem to work, but yes you need to be extra careful that you are uploading the right document because you will never have the chance to preview it.  I also noticed that although demographic data is "voluntary" the system does not actually allow you the choice of declining to give any information, except about disabilities.  Truly a tyrannical and ineffective application system, UNLV.</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>This strategic cluster hire initiative expands upon the success of our highly collaborative team of researchers who are addressing critical questions in biological and anthropological sciences from diverse perspectives. These studies, which span the range from extant to prehistoric cultures, are helping to shape perspectives about cultural and evolutionary drivers of human biology, health and disease, as well as human-enviroment interactions on many scales. The successful candidate is expected to lead teams applying modern proteomic technologies, especially mass spectrometry tools, to better understand the intersection of biological and anthropological science. Strong candidates will bring novel perspectives to partners in the University’s Laboratories of Molecular Anthropology and Microbiome Research (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://lmamr.org/">http://lmamr.org/</a> ), facilitated by access to cutting-edge equipment, including top of the line spectrometric instruments for proteomics.
</p>
<p>The primary appointment will be within either the Department of Biology or the Department of Anthropology, depending on expertise.

<p>Dartmouth College Department of Anthropology welcomes applications for the Robert A. 1925 and Catherine L. McKennan Postdoctoral Fellowship. We are seeking an archaeologist with methodological expertise and regional specialization that complements current faculty. The McKennan Fellow will be expected to teach one course of their own design, pursue independent research, and participate in the academic life of the department and the College.

<dl><dd><ul>
<li>From their website, it looks like there is only one position at a time, and it rotates throughout the subfields. The current postdoc is an archaeologist, and I've seen calls for applications for a biological anthropologist floating around this year as well, with different application requirements and a different starting date. This is the only place I've seen the archaeology posting. Does anyone know what is going on here? Are they hiring two postdocs for next year?</li>
<li>The application for an archaeologist is still active on Interfolio. Emailed the dept. administrator about it, who will be out of office untill Dec. 7. </li>
<li>To clarify the situation for prospective applicants: the Department of Anthropology at Dartmouth will hire two postdocs next year, one in Biological Anthropology (a 2-3 year position) and one in Archaeology (a one-year position), both of which are funded by the department's McKennan endowment.  Both positions were advertised on AAA and elsewhere, and will receive applications through Jan 15, 2018.  Usually there is only one McKennan postdoc at a time, rotating among subfields, but there was an unexpected departure from the position last summer, leaving a year of postdoc support available.  An archaeologist will be hired to fill this one-year position in the 2018-2019 academic year, so please consider applying! </li>

</h2>
<p>This is by far one of the worst job years I've seen in awhile--maybe even worse than the 2013-2014 year. Hope it gets better.
</p>
<ul><li>Agreed. Same for BioAnth.  Most positions this year are cultural or medical. (10/8)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>
<ul><li>This is the very worst job year I've seen since 2007. Have been in the market for 6 years and have never seen such thing. I wonder how many faculty members out there realize it's time they stop producing more PhDs who are condemened to unemployment from even before they get their degrees. That would be the ethical thing to do.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I didn't see 2007. But 2011 and 2013 also were pretty bad, especially 2013. That year was similar to this one in that there were more Classical archaeology jobs.</li></ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Yeah. I had hoped a few more Dec jobs would open up, and by now I think it's unlikely. I haven't sorted through the jobs--nor do I know how productive it would be, spiritually or otherwise--by this year's high 30's for TT jobs is down nearly a quarter from last year, and about 50% from the two years before that. And, as much as I realize having specific geographic/methodological specialities defined is a way to deal with that onslaught of job app numbers (see the 200+ for Vt), it's also so disheartening as an applicant to have such few options, or even the remote possibility of being considered outside tight constraints. Again, nearing unethical. Anyone else have thoughts on the recent trend?</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I have also been tracking archaeology jobs for the last few years. They are down massively this year and it does not look like we are going to have any late arrivals. There has also been an increasing trend in jobs requiring a certain specialism, time period or region, leaving a lot of people unable to apply. I can only imagine how many people are applying per job at the moment while at the same time we have increasing PhD students flooding into the job market every year. I have also been tracking who gets the jobs every year and there is a significant trend towards either fresh PhDs or people who already had TT jobs.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>
<ul><li>-Add to requiring specialism and region, most jobs also want explicitly environmental focus. Everything filtered through the lens of its interaction with climate change and the environment. I don't know if this is a fad or a long term trend reflecting increasing pressure to hire people who could get large grants focused on environmental sustainability.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>And the baby boomer retirement wave ain't happening. These folks are staying until they drop dead in their offices, giving universities ample time to cut lines and hire adjuncts.</li></ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li>And I would agree, but honestly, I didn't even got looked at seriously until I was a few (4) years out, and had established a publishing and external grant record post-PhD. Like you, I was also taught that unless you were picked up within 2 years post-PhD, you were dead in the water. Now, I don't know. </li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I find the rationale of who gets jobs and who doesn't increasingly mistifying. I've seen cases of freshly minted PhDs with a blank publication record and no teaching experience being picked over their own professors... And very talented, established scholars being forced to drop out after a few years in the market. We all know this is not a meritocracy and that a lot depends on who is friends with the search committee chair, but still...  Seriously, shouldn't the AAA and SAA address the issue?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>You've seen new PhDs get jobs for positions that their professors also were applying?? There's a new AA paper on the issue of the same programs leading placement across a few decades.</li>
<li>can you share the ref for that article? It sounds interesting (but depressing)</li>
<li>hmm, for some reason another user deleted the DOI for the article after I posted it the first time: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://doi.org/10.1017/aaq.2017.36">https://doi.org/10.1017/aaq.2017.36</a>
</li>
<li>And you can find the table on job placements in the Supplementary Materials</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Meanwhile... just heard UCF is opening a new PhD program next year. Isn't it unethical to be starting new PhD programs in this context?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Yes, I agree. Especially given the competition for placement would likely mean that a UCF PhD is not worth much in terms of getting a job.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>If you want to see evidence for how out of touch academics are, look at the adjunct position for Appalachain State</li></ul>
<dl><dd>
<ul><li>^^ because they ask for a letter, a CV, and teaching evals?? this is normal/minimal.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Not OP, but that's totally excessive for an adjunct position.</li></ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>I suppose there are differences in experience. I had two adjunct positions before my first job (where I sat on a committee that hired two adjuncts), and the materials that A State lists were more or less what was expected. It would seem that anyone on the job market already has these three items prepared. Departments don't want to just hire anyone with an appropriate PhD -- though adjuncts are not paid or treated well (they should be!), they are still very important to the education process, and those faculty who recommend them want to make sure that they are good. Anyway, good luck out there!  </li>
<li>Those who contributed here: I am curious about what some people seem to think is "out of touch". This past year, I was on two hiring committees for adjunct or temporary positions. We did not want to be a burden on applicants, but we also had to provide documentation to the Dean and others in administration. Could the people suggesting "out of touch" departments with "excessive" demands please reveal what they, in their experience applying to or reviewing for other universities, seems to be "reasonable" or "normal"?  </li>
</ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Wow, just realized there really isn't anything in historical archaeology this year :(</li></ul>
<p><br>
For those who didn't get TT jobs or postdocs this year (most of us?), what are your plans for the next academic year to stay afloat financially and academically? Anybody ready to move on from academia? 
</p>
<ul><li>Is dying (metaphorically or not) a valid plan? I have been in the market for... seven years now. It is safe to say now that I am academically dead. And I have seen so much unfairness, arbitrariness, pettiness, etc in the way these academic searches are conducted that it has taken away pretty much all the joy I once found in being a scholar. Thank you, academia, for turning me into a human detritus.</li></ul>
<p><br>
I hope someone is reaching out to this person "Unperfect1" posting above.  Una74 you seem to be an administrator, can you help?

<ul><li>Wow. Best of lucks to Unperfect1. All I can say (and I know this doesn't really help) is I can totally relate to your feelings/situation. I've been in the market for six years and had to leave the US, all my friends and academic connections behind to try to "stay afloat". And even that hasn't really worked out so far, so I feel pretty down at times. However, I still enjoy what I do and I am going to keep trying to find an academic job somewhere. This said, the sad reality is that most people don't really think/care about those of us who were left behind -there is not enough support from departments, advisors, etc.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I am one of the quitters. My PhD was done on a world region very few care about, on a topic that's not very sexy, and is increasingly going out of style. I even got a TT job in 2015, but in a location that was making me miserable. I stayed for a while thinking this will be the place from which I can catapult myself to "something better".  But even having achieved the mythical TT job, I was miserable, and the "something better" in a place I'd actually be happy living seemed nearly impossible, and ultimately, not worth it. I was pretty decent at all the things academics are supposed to do, writing, research, teaching, admin ... but by the time I decided to quit, none of the things that I had loved about it really gave me joy anymore. Too much stress, anxiety, too constantly feeling like I (or my work - though it's hard to separate the two) was never good enough.  Once I was out I realized academia was my abusive relationship, an abusive spouse.  It had been hurting me for years, and I just kept going back for more.  I decided I could stay in academia, and stay on a pretty hefty dose of anti-depressants, or I could quit.  So I quit. Even not knowing what I'm going to do next, I'm ok.  I'm off anti-depressants, and I can't believe how much happier I am. I'm free. The only thing I was really afraid of losing walking away from academia were the friends. For the most part, that fear turned out to be unfounded. The friends who were friends with the academic me have not rejected me, even though I have rejected academia. Good luck to all of you out there - to those staying in it, and to those getting out.  Neither one is easy.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I considered quitting on multiple occasions but have been too invested in this career to do so.  I've been on the job market for 11 years--I got my PhD right before the recession hit and had some personal issues that took me off the job market for a bit.  But I managed to hunker down, do research, write, and after a few years in a temporary position finally moved into a permanent position this year.  It's hard out there, and I don't know if it's harder in the long run to stay or go.  There's no certainty as to who's going to end up with a job, and as the previous poster said, whether those who do are going to end up being able to thrive there.  I've seen multiple colleagues drop away from academia and others get booted when they were up from tenure.  Some of my best friends got jobs in schools in places that sounded like hell to me and have thrived and found happiness there, and others who had given up on academia pop back on the scene and get killer positions and do amazing work now.  It's such a mixed bag and it's a life that's hard and rewarding and fun and frustrating and often mind numbingly boring.  Good luck to everyone. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Hang in there Unperfect1. I feel your pain. I've been unemployed for the last three years and it seems like this will be my fourth no luck job app cycle. The job market in archaeology is just too competitive at the moment, so lots of good people are having trouble finding jobs despite stellar records. It's a buyer's market so decision making is often based on very superficial reasons and search committees have the luxury of acting on unfair biases. That said, as depressing as everything is, I try to be grateful that I have a roof over my head and friends/family who love me. I am grateful also that I have the luxury of quitting academia altogether because it did give me specific skills that are valued outside of it. I think I'm going to give it one more year, and then I'm calling it quits.</li></ul>
<ul><li>--- Some thoughts: </li></ul>
<dl><dd>Best of luck to all of you!  This is not a good job market and academia is not for everyone, but there also profound flaws and deep fissures in how the academic (especially anthropology) job market is structured.  I am glad to see some people voicing their dissatisfaction with these flaws.  We all may be screaming into a vaccuum, but these things need to be said and heard. Too many faculty are ignoring these issues. For example: </dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>- Faculty: Why are there so many PhD granting institutions given the lack of jobs? Why are you accepting more students even though you are funding them at terrible levels; you provide little support; and many of you (not naming names) are not even present on campus for multiple years after you have accepted a student?  To contextualize a bit, I have seen this for years and I am disgusted with about 80% of my colleagues. I have a TT position at what I might call a "mediocre" research institution (and I don't mean that in terms of prestige level or the typical East-coast snobbery, but in simple objective terms regarding the amount of money and support we can provide students). We accept 6-8 students per year for anthropology, and of those 2-3 are typically archaeologists. About 15-20% of our students go on to academic jobs. Almost all of them enter the program wanting an academic job. Most go through 3-5 horrendous years of rejection after earning their PhD. Why is this the common model? As I said I am at a research institution (though not top-ranked by any means), so here there is some pressure to take graduate students and develop a viable research program -- but why? And why do so many faculty at such mediocre institutions <i>want </i>to develop PhD programs that, in the end, do not produce professional academics? This is unethical and self-serving, and we faculty need to start taking more responsibiity -- we are contributing to a terrible cycle of despair. </dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>- Now, part of the answer to these questions is that many university administrations (especially those at mediocre research institutions) would love to erase anthropology from the books. There are many reasons, but one is that anthropology departments simply do not generate much funding or jobs. And, since the 80s, the proliferation of "Cult Studs" departments (e.g., those departments that are X-studies and Y-studies) have made anthropology redundant and in some cases outdated (especially in comparing typical Gender Studies and Anthro offerings). Given this reality, it seems odd for anthropology faculty to want to respond to admin, to claim their "worth", by showing that they can produce more PhD students (note: the Dean often cares about how many PhD students have been graduated, not about what happens afterward, hence a professor or a department can impress the Dean by stating that they have successfully graduated X number of students). But this is often what happens. And I've now seen it at two mediocre research institution departments. Of course, there are other ways to prove that what we anthropologists do is worthwhile and viable -- but some of these will require that we reimagine anthropology beyond its Boasian definition in most of North America, and for many/most of my colleagues that is just too hard, too risky. So faculty repeat the model: accept more students; broadcast the name of the university in those students' papers and presentations; have more students to fill TA and lab positions, thus freeing faculty from onerous tasks and (hopefully) allowing for more pubs and grants. Or, I suppose the other rationale is: we can build the reputation of the department by regularly accepting students, and then if 1 of 10 of those students lands a job, and publishes, then we are more prestigious? Right? On paper this seems fine... that is, if one considers "students" to be "lines of data" on a piece of paper, instead of human beings. It would seem that, overall, the way to ETHICALLY deal with pressure about the existence of a department or to build the reputation of your department is precisely to NOT admit and then poorly fund PhD students. After all, doing so means that those other nine students are depondent and hopeless... And these days doing so also means you will often have to try your damnedest to get all students out of the program in 5-7 years to meet expectations from admin. Why would faculty sign on for this (especially given that most faculty at research institutions took and needed 8-10 years to finish their degree)? Because finishing students in a timely manner makes the program look viable and productive. But... are those students prepared for jobs? No. Not at all. I recently left a TT position that accepted and released PhD students in this way -- they actually had a quota for graduate students that needed to be out the door within a certain time. Many students, even if not ready, were coerced to defend so the department could maintain its quot). That is seriously f-ed up, and though it may further the careers of the faculty, it also ruins the lives of students and saddles them with debt. That is not an ethical trade-off. </dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>- I am on the verge of quitting academia for these reasons and others. This is all unethical. After being at a "mediocre" research institution for multiple years it seems evident that given the job market and the current state of anthropology, this is just a very difficult job. That is, it is a difficult job because, every month, I have to look students in the eye and tell them "yes, you should pursue a degree / career in archaeology." Other members of the department want us to say this to students. They tell me: "We need majors. We need full classes. We need PhD students." I ask them "What do our students do post-graduation?" They tell me: "They get jobs, just not in academia." I just can't lie to students like this. </dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p><br></p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul>
<li>^^ very well-reasoned post. I was lucky and fortunate enough to land a renewable VAP position after 200 applications (over three hiring cycles) to various academic and CRM institutions. I have several pubs, a well-known advisor, extensive teaching experience, an ongoing field project, and good evals/letters. I have literally not had a SINGLE interview request (or even a request for additional materials) since accepting the position. Zero. It sounds like our university is now going after non-TT lines to save a buck and replace them with adjuncts. Not sure what the future holds for me in academia, but I agree that the system has created a monster that is simply spiralling out of control. Completely unethical, and our current treatment of adjuncts is wage theft pure and simple. </li>
<li>I'm wondering if cutting down half the amount of doctoral students accepted by depts. and using the dept. funds to instread create a couple post-doctoral positions could somewhat repair the system. This of course wouldn't change everything, but it would not cost more to universities, bring more publications to dept, and, if done widely, slowly decrease the amound of unemployment and the quantity of poeple ready to accept unhealthy adjunct positions. If I'm not wrong, in some humanities and in theoretical sciences like Mathematics they do such things.</li>
</ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Departments across the country have to do their part to relieve some of this stress. This would include admitting less or no doctoral students at least temporarily, treating their contingent faculty more thoughtfully (e.g. help with moving costs, reasonable teaching load, professional development support), and NOT ASKING FOR RECOMMENDATION LETTERS UP FRONT whether it's a tenure track job, postdoc, or otherwise. Despite the AAA statement regarding these letters, departments are still unethically and callously asking for letters up front. This year, the guilty North American arch/anthro departments are (please update if I've missed any):
