</h3>
<p>The Department of Anthropology invites applications from outstanding scholars for two tenure-track positions, at the Assistant Professor level. The position is to begin September 1, 2019, pending budgetary and administrative approval.
</p>
<p>Candidates should have exceptional records in research and teaching anthropological archaeology and who take a big-picture approach to studies of: (1) the earlier Pleistocene record; or (2) complex societies in the Holocene, such as the development of urbanism and the rise of states and empires. Regional specialty is open. We seek individuals with a theoretical outlook rooted in evolutionary theory and who complement research of current faculty in the Late Pleistocene of Central Asia and animal domestication in Europe and the Near East. Possible specializations include but are not restricted to: paleoclimate and geochemistry, computer and mathematical modeling, and spatial analysis. We will favor candidates with ongoing field- and lab-based projects. The successful candidates will be affiliated with and contribute to the mission of the Center for the Study of Human Origins (CSHO), helping shape the archaeology program along four main milestones: the emergence of the earliest cultures, the appearance and dispersal of Homo sapiens, the food production revolution, and the development of inequality, institutions, and urbanism.
</p>
<ul><li>Initial application deadline is <b>November 15, 2018,</b> but all applications will be considered until the position is filled. Please apply online at (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://apply.interfolio.com/53487">http://apply.interfolio.com/53487</a>) with a cover letter, CV listing contact information for three confidential references, a research and teaching statement, and a statement of diversity and inclusion. As diversity is an important part of the NYU mission, for the latter statement we ask you to provide a brief paragraph telling us how diversity figures into your past and present teaching, research, community engagement, and/or life experience, as well as how you would bring issues of diversity to bear on the teaching and programming of NYU's Department of Anthropology.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>What's the story with the theoretical perspective? I understand with the number 1, but most people studying complex societies aren't really using evolutionary theory, unless it's social evolutionary theory or the more darwinian side of collective action theory. Is that what it's getting at?</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Anyone else slightly confused with the online portal, where they wanted the T&amp;R statements submitted with the cover letter, but here in the job ad they look like separate documents (i.e. three documents in total rather than one)? I am happy to just send the standard R1 cover (2p), which mentions both teaching and research, and am hesitant to merge in my research and teaching statements after (thereby making it a 5p packet), unless that's what they want? Thoughts from other applicants?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>They confirm they want a statement on research and teaching within the cover letter. The Interfolio also lists a requirement of 5 writing samples- they also confirm this is correct and need to be research publications.</li>
<li>Just to clarify: does this mean that they want the typical few paragraphs on research and teaching WITHIN the standard, 2p, R1 cover letter (i.e. what most of us consider a typical cover letter)? Or do they want two separate pages (titled something imaginative like, 'research statement,' and 'teaching statement') combined into a single 4p document, which is then uploaded as a 'cover letter' on Interfolio? Maybe it's just me, but this seems like an exceptionally convoluted posting....</li>
<li>Same question as above- I wonder who in the department we could address the question to?</li>
<li>Checked with department member, they want three separate documents: (1) a standard R1 2 page cover letter, (2) CV, and (3) a diversity statement. Note also that the 5 publications upload requirement is no longer listed. Was told one can submit as many extra documents as desired in "Additional Documents" section. </li>
</ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>(Deadline is listed as November 15, 2018 on Interfolio. The department confirmed that the official closing date is <b>Nov. 15</b>)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Request for Letters of Recommnedation (12/7) - I applied for the complex societies position...  </li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>^^does this refer to both the early Pleistocene and complex societies positions?</li>
<li>I applied for the complex societies position my referees were asked for letters on 12/7</li>
<li>Short list invited to campus. Candidates include existing R1 tenure line Assistant Professors (1/14).
<ul>
<li>Curious, do you mean tenure line APs are on the Pleistocene short list, or the complex societies one?</li>
<li>The two searches seem to be moving at slightly different paces. The Pleistocene one invited short listed candidates in late December.</li>
<li>Anyone hear any updates on this, on either position?  (4/3)</li>
<li>Pleistocene person announced on twitter he accepted the position on March 24, not sure about Holocene.</li>

<dl><dd>
<ul><li>campus interviews are currently being scheduled [posted 10/21]</li></ul>
<dl><dd>
<ul><li>Really? This is the second job that has gone straight to campus interviews less than two weeks after the app deadline. Inside hires?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>Less than two? This was less than one. How is that even possible? I've no clue how many applications, but I can't see how they had less than 300 applications and probably more. And this job has the fattest application of any job this year. Just saying.</li>
<li>Yea, no way they consulted letters of rec for their short list. Zero zero zero chance. Can anyone back up or second the campus interview post? I realize SDS was quick, but not this quick. Impossible that applications were thoroughly vetted.</li>
<li>Totally agreed. If this is true, they must have a had a short-list before they even reviewed applications, which is just *great* (eyeroll) for all of the people who prepared their six documents for this position.  I didn't apply, so no personal pain here, but this seems disappointing if not a bit disingenuous to others.  One wonders who is calling these shots, given Chicago's reputation for being an anth department without many (or any) archaeologists on campus at a given time. </li>
<li>And don't they have to have a faculty meeting to OK a short list? It's gotta be a very very well integrated and focused department to have a committee go through 100s of applications, create a short-list, and have it approved by the broader faculty in one five day period. I'm just baffled by this, to the point I think it's either an uber-inside thing or someone is trolling the wiki.</li>
<li>In my experience, a faculty meeting is not always necessary to approve a short list.  In an ideal setting, the hiring committee reads the applications, comes up with long and then short lists, and then invites those candidates to campus.  Other faculty are typically not involved until the candidates arrive.  Could be different at other places, of course.  My serious question here:  (if this is true that they called people in within days of receiving the apps) is this how all of these top-ranked programs operate?  Do they actually vet applicants and read applications, or do they assemble and tactily decide on a pool of candidates by reaching out to colleagues and building from networks?  I know of at least two other top-tier searches for which the candidates seemed "chosen in advance due to networks or conference participation" much more than "carefully selected from a pile of documents."</li>
<li>The short answer: yes, this happens all the time. I think it is more the exception than the rule that search committees DONT have at least a few people in mind that they know or have been highly recommended through various networks. I would guess this is particularly true at top-tier universities. It just usually isnt so blatant as to skip the Skype interview stage and just move to campus invites four days after an app deadline. Search committee members: if you are going to do this at least have the courtesy not to make people write multiple documents, incurring potentially days of wasted time.</li>
<li>^^ I also suspect it happens all of the time.  It would actually be counter-productive for committee members to <i>not </i>reach out to colleagues and ask about promising scholars, or to call to mind those conference participants that they have found appealing. But, it is not only counterproductive but also <i>absurd</i> and <i>lazy</i> to simply "go with" those recommendations of colleagues and not even consider a fat stack of applications that surely contains some very well-qualified candidates. Surely this is the way that "the elites" of academia operate -- relying on and reproducing their exclusive network rather than seeking to recognize potentials outside of that network -- but it still stinks.  </li>
</ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>
<ul><li>Will be interesting to see how this plays out... How does a department with absolutely no apparent commitment to archaeological methodologies or laboratories hire a specialist to "diversify laboratory methodologies"? </li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I dunno. This could indicate many things. They just lost someone who did environmental arch and palynology</li></ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>3 Presentations by Environmental Archaeologists are now listed on their Dept. calendar. First presentation listed is 5 1/2 weeks after application submission deadline. (11/5)</li></ul>

<p>The Department of Anthropology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst invites applications for an open-rank tenured/tenure-track position in archaeology, beginning September 2019.
</p>
<p>The successful candidate will show evidence of scholarly excellence and accomplished teaching commensurate with rank. This hire is part of a larger initiative to build an innovative program in archaeology for the 21st century; as such we are looking for a scholar who takes seriously the role of archaeology in the contemporary world and who is committed to engaging responsibly and creatively with academic and non-academic communities. In addition to experience with the more traditional fieldwork, excavation, or methods of material analysis of the discipline, we encourage applicants who have interest and/or experience and ability to teach innovative theoretical, topical, and methodological approaches in archaeology, such as:
</p>
<p>archaeology in a world in crisis (e.g. engaging with climate change issues; documenting conflict areas/threatened heritage; understanding migration and cross-cultural engagement; or (de)coloniality, race and inequality); and/or,
bringing community-based practices into CRM, heritage management, archival practices, etc.; and/or,
exploratory or community-based digital, sensory, or visual methods (e.g. 3D printing/modelling, cultural mapping, sensory archaeology &amp; landscapes, archaeo-gaming, VR and augmented reality).
Archaeologists with transdisciplinary interests who will strengthen links between the subfields and with adjacent disciplines (e.g. material culture studies, (post-)coloniality, critical heritage studies, sensory studies, public health, popular culture, museum studies, human geography, etc.) are particularly encouraged to apply.
The teaching load is 2/2, and we seek a candidate who has a strong record of external funding who can engage students in their research/fieldwork, advise Honors and MA/PhD research projects, and complement the broader department interest in community-based research and historical processes of power and inequality. The Department values research and teaching that spans the subfields of the discipline. The candidate should have a PhD in Anthropology in hand at time of appointment.

<p>The department of Anthropology at the University of Massachusetts Boston invites applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor in historical archaeology of the African Diaspora, to begin on September 1, 2019. Strong preference will be given to candidates specializing outside the U.S., particularly ones who have active research projects in the Caribbean, Mesoamerica, Central America, or South America.
</p>
<p>We seek an accomplished researcher with a healthy publication profile and an experienced instructor with a strong teaching record who will contribute to the department's thriving undergraduate program and successful M.A. Program in Historical Archaeology. Ideal candidates should be trained at the intersections of historical archaeology, cultural anthropology, and ethnic studies and experienced with interdisciplinary collaborations; be committed to teaching in an urban public university setting; be able to teach courses in archaeology, heritage, and African Diaspora studies that range across larger undergraduate introductory courses to smaller upper-division offerings to graduate seminars; and be notably engaged with contemporary issues and communities. Areas of potential research interest include, but are not limited to, identity, race, labor, gender, colonialism, resistance, inequality, indigeneity, globalization, heritage, space, expressive arts and ritual, and the environment. The new hire will work closely with the department’s own Fiske Center for Archaeological Research and will be encouraged to build further connections to the Transnational, Cultural, and Communities Studies graduate program and the department of Africana Studies.
</p>
<p>The department would be particularly receptive to candidates who can involve undergraduate and graduate students in field and laboratory work.

<p>Desirable qualifications include possible specializations in biomolecular methods, comparative anatomy, and geometric morphometrics; to investigate and interpret faunal data in a variety of cultural contexts; advancing our understanding of taphonomy/taphonomic processes and their importance to osteoarchaeological studies; and biomolecular techniques, such as DNA analysis, proteomics and stable isotope analysis. Knowledge of NAGPRA is also desirable, as the successful candidate will collaborate with UTK curators who engage with Native American tribal nations across the United States on matters of NAGPRA compliance.
</p>
<p>The candidate should engage in multidisciplinary research and teaching, and have strong methodological and theoretical capabilities that intersect with the department’s archaeology, cultural, and forensic/biological anthropology programs. These programs include research into ancient biomolecules, functional and comparative anatomy, taphonomy, foodways, human/animal interactions, and ancient ecosystems, and collaboration with related disciplines such as biology, medicine, zoology, ecology, evolutionary biology, climatology and paleontology.
</p>
<p>The candidate will be expected to assist with the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, including the teaching of introductory archaeology, principles of zooarchaeology (including advanced seminars and laboratory courses), and courses in their area of expertise in rotation. Inter-subdisciplinary orientations that interface with biological/forensic anthropology and/or cultural anthropology, and the ability to teach qualitative/mixed methods are highly desired. The successful candidate will be expected to serve on and chair MA and PhD committees from the start, and to mentor students for both academic and other professional career trajectories.
</p>
<p>The successful candidate will develop a research program around our department and university’s cutting-edge research facilities with our internationally renowned zooarchaeological collections and will oversee curation and research with these collections. The candidate should demonstrate capacity to obtain external research funding and to publish in the highest tier journals.
</p>
<p>Ph.D. must be in hand at the time of appointment.

</h3>
<p>The Natural History Museum of Utah (NHMU) and the Department of Anthropology at the University of Utah invite applications for a tenure-track joint position as Curator of Archaeology and Assistant Professor of Anthropology beginning July 1, 2019. The majority of this split appointment is funded by the Museum, but retention, promotion, and tenure decisions will be made according to the Department criteria.
</p>
<p>The successful candidate will maintain a strong field- and collections-based research program involving students. Duties also include overseeing the curation and continued development of the Anthropology collections, teaching one formal course per year in the Department of Anthropology, participating in Museum public programs and exhibit development, supervising graduate students in the Department, as well as participating in Department governance.
</p>
<p>NHMU and the Department of Anthropology have recently moved to new, state-of-the-art facilities equipped with laboratories, collection storage rooms, lecture halls, and student work space. For NHMU this move allowed for the inspection, reorganization, and completion of the database for remarkable collections, ranging from some of the earliest artifacts in the Great Basin (Danger Cave) to modern Navajo baskets. Numbering nearly one million objects, the Anthropology collections relate primarily to the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau. NHMU has research strengths in biodiversity science, including curators with expertise in vertebrate zoology, botany, mycology, genomics, paleoecology, paleontology, and archaeology (paleoethnobotany and zooarchaeology).
</p>
<p>Candidates must have a strong record of research and publication in the prehistory of western North America, with preference for work in the Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, or prehistoric Southwest. Potential to develop field- and collections-based research projects in Utah is essential. Research focus and methodological expertise is open, but preference will be given to applicants cognizant of the research potential of the collections, whose work will support graduate student training and generate significant extramural support, and who complement the strong evolutionary and ecological perspective of current Anthropology faculty and NHMU curators. In addition, potential to contribute to the NHMU Sustaining Biodiversity initiative (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://nhmu.utah.edu/sustaining-biodiversity">https://nhmu.utah.edu/sustaining-biodiversity</a>) is favorable.
</p>
<p>To apply, submit an application on-line (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://utah.peopleadmin.com/postings/85384">https://utah.peopleadmin.com/postings/85384</a>) that includes a CV, three sample publications, contact information for exactly three references, and a letter of interest that addresses: (1) research, (2) teaching, (3) collections, (4) programmatic interests, i.e. how your research may impact and contribute to exhibits and public programs at the museum, and (5) how your work and experience can contribute to the success of underrepresented students. Candidates must have a completed Ph.D. by time of appointment. Questions may be directed to the Museum’s Executive Director, Sarah George (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="mailto:sgeorge@nhmu.utah.edu">sgeorge@nhmu.utah.edu)</a> and/or the Chair of Anthropology, Leslie Knapp (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="mailto:leslie.knapp@anthro.utah.edu">leslie.knapp@anthro.utah.edu</a>).

<li>LORs requested 1/24 (2x)</li>
<li>Anyone see that this position was reposted yesterday with applications "will continue until filled"? Wondering what that means for those that seem to have made the long list as well as those that didn't...
<ul>
<li>Yes, I noticed that too. Posting is the same except original Jan 7th deadline removed.</li>
<li>This is disappointing given that the deadline was 3 weeks ago and our ref letters aren't even due for over a week. Maybe they aren't satisfied with those of us on the long list.</li>
<li>It's possible the department/museum is happy with the long list, but there are institutional guidelines stipulating that a post must be up for a minimum number of days or have a certain number of applicants, and they're simply re-posting to meet those guidelines so a dean doesn't reject the shortlist on those grounds. That's my hopeful guess.</li>

<dl><dd>
<ul><li>Is this position requiring letters up front, or is this just a warning that emails will be automatically generated? The ad says "After you have submitted all of the required documents, you will see a confirmation number. At that point, each of the three referees whose email address you have provided will receive an automatically-generated email requesting that he or she submit a letter of reference for you."</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>The letters are requested via automatically generated e-mails; as soon as I submitted, my referees received an e-mail, clearly before any review could be done by a human. So, it sounds like they do want the letters up front </li>
<li>In my experience, some university's HR systems automatically generate these emails whether or not the search committee wants them yet. That happened to me more than once last year. Kind of an annoyingly ambiguously worded job ad, since having to get letters up front is a pain, and I'd hate to ask for them if they're not even needed.</li>
<li>I emailed the dept to confirm, and yes, they want letters up front. So tempted to email them back with the AAA policy... Are the people who come up with these applications not tired of writing endless letters for their own students?</li>
<li>Indeed. Thanks for confirming. I also confirmed over the phone with the program admin asst that they want letters up front. Did you email with the admin asst or a search committee member? I would be curious if a search committee member has actually confirmed this requirement yet.</li>
<li>I am not actually applying for this (no interest in East Coast living), so I am going to send a very polite email to the search chair reminding them of the AAA policy.  Perhaps someone who is not applying to the Kenyon College position could do the same?</li>
<li>I wrote them and sent a link to the AAA policy; here's the response: "We are well aware of the problem. The administration requires the letters from all candidates and they will not grant Anthropology an exemption. They also created the boilerplate for the job descriptions regarding letters and they control the application system which as set up automatically generates the letter requests."  </li>
</ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<ul><li>I'd say that's a red flag for how counterproductively bureaucratic that institution may be, as well as an indication of a lack of regard for people in vulnerable employment positions already...</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>I don't understand - why would it indicate a lack of regard for people in vulnerable employment positions already? (Real question, not snarky comment!).</li>
<li>I suppose the commenter is stating that it seems as though the folks who organized the terms of this search are not even thinking of what it is like to be applying for academic jobs, to be scrambling to put together application materials while under pressure to meet other deadlines, and to be contacting committee members for up front letters.  Applicants should spend time editing and tailoring their job letter and teaching/research statements.  Hence, they should <i>not </i>be required to chase down committee members for up front letters, especially seeing as most of these letters will never be read when the hiring committee is making the first cut of the applications.  In my experience as assistant prof, I have come to know the stifling and irrational bureaucracy of a university system.  But I have never heard of administration demanding that departments conduct their searches in a particular way, in terms of the timing of when materials come in.  After all, the deans and administrators do not review recommendation letters when they come in, and they might only do so after a recommendation for hire can been made.  So this smells like hogwash.  I'm not applying to this one so no horse in the race.  </li>
<li>Ah, I see. Thank you. It is absolutely true that up-front letters are a waste of everyone's time. I have been on search committees in the same boat (i.e., the university-wide system requires LoR to be submitted as part of the applications) and it is uncomfortable (though obviously less time-consuming) on the other end too. Some professors, asked to write many letters for the same position, rightly express their frustrations. But I wouldn't say it has anything at all to do with the department (or even the university) having a lack of regard for people - in fact, it probably comes out of some move to be "fair" (e.g., making sure every candidate's materials are recevied and a record of them as received is made, rather than their going to the inbox of a SC chair or department admin)</li>
<li>I'd counter that the intent of the university/SC are immaterial and what actually matters is the impact of putting candidates into an untenable position in terms of how many favors they have to ask for (and budget for). Being on the market means performing a careful calculus about how often to ask for letters, advice, feedback, etc., lest you alienate/annoy your allies. The stakes are big because coming up the next year without academic employment can mean the end of your faculty career.</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Did anyone hear anything on this yet?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>Nope.  I'd guess they're still reading the LORs they requested...</li>
<li>This search has to have moved ahead by now, right? My guess is that they are considering primarily 'advanced tenure track' types.</li>
<li>For what it's worth, they accepted LORs until Friday November 9th. They may have not started really reviewing until Monday the 12th. Assuming they got 100-200+ apps, plus the Thanksgiving holiday, it's maybe not a bad sign that there's no movement yet.</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Contacted for Skype interview <b>11/28</b> [x3]</li></ul>
<p>Anyone contacted for campus visits yet?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Not yet. They said they would contact in late Jan. School there started last week, so perhaps this week (if they haven't done so already)?</li>
<li>Rejection email stating they had 233 applicants and have "completed interviewing candidates."</li>

We invite applications from scholars who have completed the Ph.D. within the last three years with a specialization in archaeology (broadly defined). We especially seek applicants who offer areas of research and teaching that complement the existing CIAMS faculty (see <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://archaeology.cornell.edu/faculty">https://archaeology.cornell.edu/faculty</a>). Given Cornell’s strengths in Mediterranean and Near Eastern archaeology, we do not encourage applications from specialists in those areas, but are open to applicants who do research in any other part of the world.

<p>Applications are invited for a <b>1 year renewable </b>postdoctoral position that will start on <b>January 2019 </b>(may be slightly delayed for exceptional conditions) for research on <b>Neolithic human diet and mobility </b>by means of multi-isotopic analyses in correlation with other archaeological sciences deployed in the transdisciplinary project "NEOGENRE". 
</p>
<p><i><b>The “NEOGENRE” ANR research project </b></i>:
The funding for this postdoctoral position has been made available by the ANR (<i>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</i>), through the project entitled “Gender relations in the Neolithic: biology, societies, symbols (NEOGENRE)” (Projet-ANR-17-CE27-0023) led by Aline Thomas (<i>Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle</i>)<i>. </i>This project aims to shed light on the role of sexual dimorphism within the organization of European Neolithic populations (Paris and Rhine basins), which were among the first complex and ostensibly hierarchical societies (5th millennium BC). At a societal level, the project seeks to reveal the discriminatory dynamics of the expressions of gender. From an anthropological and biological standpoint, it seeks to evaluate the inter-population variability of sexual dimorphism in relation to environmental, natural and cultural factors. In this manner, the NEOGENRE project aspires to study the manifestations of difference, as well as shed light upon a wide variety of spheres of Neolithic life, including ideology, power, activities, health, diet and mobility. The analysis of the human remains is inclusive (morphological, paleo-pathological, isotopic and paleo-genetic) and the cultural data is contextualized and informed by specialized and direct analysis of the burials and the grave goods. 
</p>
<p><i><b>The postdoctoral position </b></i>:
The home laboratory of the postdoctoral position is the <i>Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle. </i>
</p>
<p>The successful applicant will be geographically assigned into two units of research, successively: 
</p>
<dl><dd>Laboratory of <i>Lampea UMR 7269 </i>(Aix-en-Provence) under the supervision of Estelle Herrscher in collaboration with Vincent Balter from the <i>Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon UMR 5276 </i>(Lyon), for the first analytical portion of the project. </dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Laboratory of <i>Eco-anthropologie UMR 7206 </i>(MNHN, Paris) for the processing of the raw data and the crossing of data with the other related bio-archaeological research, under the supervision of Aline Thomas. This laboratory provides a multidisciplinary theoretical framework (genetic, ethnological, anthropological) for the theme of nutrition (adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, nutritional transition, image of the body, perception of food). </dd></dl>
<p><i><b>Technical skills </b></i>:
The project focuses on French human Neolithic material that is new from an isotopic point of viewδ. The planned methodological approaches include isotope analyses on bone and dentin collagen (δ13C, δ15N, δ34S and on bioapatite (Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca, 44Ca, 87Sr/86Sr). As related to the issue of diet and residential mobility, a scientific monitoring will aim to stay at the forefront of the isotopic techniques, methods and markers exploited, in relation to the rapid progress of research in this field. The challenge will be to maintain an exploratory approach, throughout several stages of analysis. 
</p>
<p><i><b>Qualifications and job requirements </b></i>:
Requirements include a Ph.D. in anthropological archaeology or geochemistry and a record of achievement in the use of stable isotopic analysis. 
</p>
<p><i>Required: </i>
</p>
<dl><dd>Training and experience with laboratory techniques on bio-archaeological material (preparation of samples for C, N, S, O and Sr analysis) </dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Effective time management skills and ability to efficiently coordinate research analyses through to publication </dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The ability to work independently on his/her own topic and in collaboration within an interdisciplinary research group </dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Candidates are expected to be enthusiastic about learning and exploring interdisciplinary research topics </dd></dl>
<dl><dd>We are seeking for individuals fascinated by archaeology and archaeological science, passionate about research, and keen to be a part of a young, growing, and dynamic interdisciplinary project </dd></dl>
<p><i>Advantageous: </i>
</p>
<dl><dd>Experience of fieldwork or laboratory research focused on human remains </dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Experience working in cultural resource management (contract archaeology) or in academic excavation and scientific research settings </dd></dl>

I applied for an archaeology job at Southern Mississippi back in December. It was for Assistant Prof. of Anthropology at the School of Social Science and Global Studies. But I have not seen anything about it on the Wiki. Did anybody else apply for that? Have you heard anything from them?
</p>
<ul>
<li>I applied for that one as well. Signing onto their application portal, it lists my review status as "In Review." I have not heard anything from them.</li>
<li>They have invited candidates for campus interviews this month. </li>
<li>Heard that campus interviews are almost complete--possibly in negotiation stage.</li>
<li>Heard from a good grapevine source that offered was made and ACCEPTED</li>
</ul>
<p>To anyone with SKILLS:  University of Florida has posted three jobs this season (Latin American Archaeologist; Museum Studies; and Director of the Latin American Studies Center).  I do not see these posted here.  Could someone post these so folks can see how to apply, and also so applicants can follow any job news and developments?  I would do so, but I have no SKILLS.  (Maybe that's why I don't have a TT job?!!  Ooof... damn that hurt).  Thnx! 
</p>
<p>Quick question. Curious (not on market). Did the Harvard and the Vermont jobs from last year not pan out? I don't see any updates to their faculty websites. Understand that there might just be start of year delays.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Last I heard the job was offered to someone, but that person may still be negotiating.</li>
<li>Heard the Harvard position has now been accepted.
<ul><li>Their <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://anthropology.fas.harvard.edu/faculty">faculty page</a> now lists the hire.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>UVM hire is up under their "courses" page for the fall semester (and in a academia update), so that went through at least - (it ended up being a Mayanist).</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>At least two finalists were Maya archaeolgoists for this position</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>I just want to leave this here. Directly from the AAA website's policies for employers posting job ads:
</p>
<dl><dd>"Solicitation of letters of recommendation should occur only after an initial screening of candidates to minimize inconvenience to applicants and referees. Names of references may be requested, however."</dd></dl>
<p><b>Quick piece of advice to either assuage or intensify worry</b>: If you want to see if your application has gotten any nibbles, check your stats on your academia.edu page since you submitted materials
</p>
<p><br><b>SOMEONE IS DELETING UPDATES</b>
Just noticed that an update I posted last week had been deleted. I went through the edit history and realized the same person had deleted several updates and comments to other job searches. Like me, they weren't signed in, so anyone's guess. I don't have time to monitor this, so i guess it's communal policing (is there a monitor)? At the least, we may want to occasionally check for deletions in the history (or turn them off?). The forums reliability and integrity will be destroyed if it keeps getting sabotaged. The only edits you should ever change (if ever) are your own-- NEVER anyone elses!!
</p>
<p>For what it's worth, the edits I undid were: Revision 564373 by [Special:Contributions/2606:A000:618C:CF00:B08A:EDA:64B1:1C80|2606:A000:618C:CF00:B08A:EDA:64B1:1C80]] (<span class="new" title="User talk:2606:A000:618C:CF00:B08A:EDA:64B1:1C80 (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvVXNlcl90YWxrOjI2MDY6QTAwMDo2MThDOkNGMDA6QjA4QTpFREE6NjRCMToxQzgwP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==">talk</span>)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for catching this ... haven't had time to investigate this specific case, but a lot of times deletions are accidental. One way to cut back on accidents: edit individual sections rather than the full page when possible. Otherwise, if you see a deletion, rather than posting about it, try to "undo" it right away. And always do feel free to contact administrators, like me (although I've had to be away more than I'd like, so communal effort is necessary too). --<a href="/wiki/User:Una74" title="User:Una74">Una74</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Una74" title="User talk:Una74">talk</a>) 23:52, December 1, 2018 (UTC)</li>
<li>It looks like this is still happening - I saw updates to the UChicago job where they were interviewing more candidates ( I think there were a couple comments) that have been removed.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
The job market is abyssmal this year, again.
</p>
<ul><li>Sure is, and many of these positions seem to be advancing rapidly to long/short lists. Makes me think many are going to internal or targeted hires. Rough for those of us in the limbo of temporary positions and adjuncting. </li></ul>
<p>Anyone know anything about the anthropology instructor (not archaeology specific, but open for archaeologists) position at Southeast Missouri State University? I didn't see it posted here, but apps were due Nov. 15th.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I just checked my application status, and it says "Search Committee Review." I haven't heard from them since I submitted my application.</li>
<li>It's listed over on the cultural anthropology page. As campus is closing up tomorrow it looks like news on phone interview invites will be forthcoming in January.</li>
<li>Still no movement on the SEMO position?</li>
<li>Request for phone interview 1/24</li>
<li>Any news since campus visits last month?</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>I dont see the University of Colorado-Boulder Curator of Archaeology/Asst. Prof. of Anthropology job on here. Received a LOR request (12/14)
</p>
<ul><li>Anyone up for the Boulder job hear anything after LOR request?
<ul>
<li>They requested phone interviews last week. (1/14/2019; x2)</li>
<li>I received an email (after doing a phone interview) that my application has been "forwarded to departmental review" (1/25/2019)</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>What about the non-TT archaeology position at Kent State -  has anyone heard anything about this job
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing here</li>
<li>I just added a listing for the position in the non-TT section here, but I haven't heard anything.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Has anyone heard anything regarding the Bridgewater State position?  I had a phone interview in December, but never heard back. 
</p>
<p>- They started contacting references this week (2/26). 
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I see that the Oregon State University Instructor (fixed term, Anthro/Arch) position isn't listed. Deadline was Feb. 15, 2019. Posted here in case anyone has updates.
</p>
<ul><li>Request for phone interview (4/12)<br> </li></ul>
<p><br>
- Never saw it posted here, but there was a last-minute call for applications (requiring only to submit a cv by email) for a 1-yr VAP in Mesoamerican archaeology at University of Pittsburgh, which closed on the last week of February. 
</p>
<p>- Additional information (T&amp;R statement, letters of rec) was requested on March 4.
</p>
<p>- Has anyone heard anything back since then?
</p>
<p>- The position has been filled. 
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>
Any updates on the U Memphis applied archaeology instructor position (review began 22 April 2019 and skype interviews began 1 May 2019)?
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>
Adding a spot for a different Boston University archaeology lecturer job (in "archaeological sciences and/or geospatial analyses"). It was posted to SAA on March 1, and said review of applications would begin February 27? I applied anyway. Any updates appreciated.
</p>
<p><br>
Have to vent here. Just back from the SAAs, where I spend three nights in a hotel room with four other people (which I paid for mostly out-of-pocket), sat through session after session where people who have landed jobs gave their crappy, last-minute papers as the rest of us give it our best to try to impress the people we hope might someday hire us, and was completely demoralized by the fact that the orgnaization did nothing to prevent a known sexual harasser from attending the conference. The cherry on top was hearing over and over again that so many of this year's jobs went ot people who <i>already have </i>tenure-track jobs. Which seems to happen every year. When there's already not enough to go around, some people just can't seem to stop dipping into the pot. So here i am, at the end of another cycle, hoping someone else's leftover will get reposted in the fall and that I can just stay afloat one more year...See you all on the 2019-2020 Wiki.
</p>

<p><br>
Any updates on Bridgewater State University?  It's been a few weeks since the campus visits ended.
