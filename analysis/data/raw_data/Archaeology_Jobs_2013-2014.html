<p>The Department of Culture and Society Archaeology, invites applications for either an assistant professorship or an associate professorship in prehistoric archaeology.
</p>
<p>In case of an assistant professorship, the position is a three-year training position. An associate professorship will be advertised in the field covered by the position in continuation of the assistant professorship. In case of an associate professorship, the position is a permanent full-time position.
</p>
<p>The position is available from <b>1 January 2014</b> or as soon as possible thereafter.
</p>
<p>The position: The position is affiliated with the Prehistoric Archaeology Programme, which, together with Moesgård Museum, has established a strong research environment. In the light of the interdisciplinary environment and the unique university and museum facilities, we are looking for an assistant/associate professor who is prepared to participate in and develop the many possibilities within Aarhus University's core activities in the areas of research, education, talent development and knowledge exchange.
</p>
<p>Research: The successful applicant will be expected to have ambitious and visionary research goals that can result in international projects and excellent research in the subject-related disciplines and topics. A research interest in the Neolithic Period in Northern Europe would be an advantage, but not a prerequisite. Emphasis is also placed on interdisciplinary collaboration and participation in collective research projects. For further information about the research field at Aarhus University, please visit this website.
</p>
<p>Education: The successful applicant will be expected to teach and guide at all levels of the undergraduate and graduate degree programmes in archaeology. In addition, applicants should be prepared to teach courses in the broader field of cultural history, including the Neolithic Period, as well as courses on the theory and methodology of archaeology.
</p>
<p>Knowledge exchange: Applicants should document interest in and preferably experience with knowledge exchange with society in these fields.
</p>
<p>Talent development: In case of an associate professorship, the successful applicant is expected to undertake supervision of PhD students and to contribute to the development and implementation of PhD courses within the field.
In case of an assistant professorship, the successful applicant is expected to develop supervisory skills during the period of employment as an assistant professor.
</p>
<p>For more information on the position, please contact Degree Programme Director, Associate Professor Mette Svart Kristiansen, markmsk@hum.au.dk or tel. +45 87 16 20 84.
</p>
<p>Qualification requirements: Applicants for the assistant professorship must have a doctoral degree in prehistoric archaeology or equivalent degree. Applicants for the assistant professorship must also have teaching experience corresponding at least to the experience gained during a PhD degree programme. Applicants for the associate professorship must have scholarly qualifications at an international level and teaching qualifications equivalent to those acquired in an assistant professorship.
</p>
<p>Applicants for the associate professorship must be able to document:
- a clear, methodical and theoretical international research profile
- important research findings within the field of prehistoric archaeology
- experience with and visionary approaches to the development of archaeology and the field’s interaction with other research fields at Aarhus University
- participation in national and international research networks
- experience with or an interest in communication and knowledge exchange
- extensive teaching and supervision experience, including experience with innovative teaching methods, such as involvement of students, IT-based courses and teaching development.
</p>
<p>Documented research experience in the Neolithic Period in Northern Europe would be an advantage, but not a prerequisite.
</p>
<p>Applicants for the assistant professorship must be able to document experience with or an interest in the above fields at PhD level.
</p>
<p>As part of our research and teaching team, the successful applicant is expected to contribute to local development and to contribute to the academic environment both internally within the department and in collaboration with the rest of Aarhus University. Participation in the daily life of the programme is a high priority, and we emphasise the importance of good working relationships, both among colleagues and to our students.
</p>
<p>If the successful applicant is not fluent in Danish, he or she will be expected to learn Danish within a period of approximately two years.
</p>
<p>It should be clearly indicated whether the application is for the assistant professorship or the associate professorship.
</p>
<p>The application must be uploaded in English. For more information about the application and the employment procedure, please contact HR partner Louise Søndergaard, e-mail ls@hum.au.dk

<p>About Binghamton University: Binghamton University has built a reputation as a world-class institution that combines a broadly interdisciplinary, international education with one of the most vibrant research programs in the nation. Binghamton is proud to be ranked among the elite public universities in the nation for challenging our students academically, not financially. The result is a unique, best-of-both-worlds college experience.
</p>
<p>Our academic culture rivals a first-rate private university - rigorous, collaborative and boldly innovative -- while our campus culture exemplifies the best kind of public university experience: richly diverse students, active social life and deep engagement with the community.
</p>
<p>Our students, both undergraduate and graduate, work one-on-one with an exceptional faculty that includes innovative scientists and groundbreaking scholars. They take advantage of special academic opportunities like combined degrees, foreign language study groups and an unparalleled international education program.
</p>
<p>Job Description: Assistant Professor, Greek and/or Roman Archaeology
</p>
<p>Binghamton University invites applications for a tenure-track position at the rank of Assistant Professor in the Department of Classical and Near Eastern Studies (CNES), beginning fall 2014. We are seeking an archaeologist whose research centers on the ancient Greek and/or Roman worlds broadly defined. Specialization within those parameters is open, but should offer innovative perspectives on material and visual culture, an emerging focus of interdisciplinary study at Binghamton University. An active field research program is desirable, as is an interest in enriching the experiences of undergraduates through study-abroad or participation in archaeological fieldwork.
</p>
<p>Candidates should expect to offer courses relating to the material culture of the ancient Mediterranean world. That will include offerings in archaeological methods and theory as well as in the successful candidate's area of expertise. Teaching should complement current culture-civilization offerings in Classics within CNES; some courses will count toward the undergraduate major in History. Candidates should also expect to contribute to language sequences in Latin and/or ancient Greek. The teaching load in CNES is five courses per academic year (2/3 or 3/2). This position has been approved for funding by the University administration as an affiliated position for Materials and Visual Worlds, one of five Transdisciplinary Areas of Excellence (TAEs) that Binghamton University has identified for growth under the auspices of its SUNY2020 plan. The successful candidate will contribute to the development of this TAE as an area of intensive research and teaching. The search committee will include members of the Material and Visual Worlds steering committee. For more information on the TAEs, go to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://binghamton.edu/academics/provost/tae2013.html">http://binghamton.edu/academics/provost/tae2013.html</a>.
</p>
<p>Requirements:  The successful candidate must have the PhD or its equivalent in hand by the start of the appointment.
</p>
<p>Additional Information:  It is the policy of the Binghamton University to provide for and promote equal opportunity employment, compensation, and other terms and conditions of employment without discrimination on the basis of age, race, color, religion, disability, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, veteran or military service member status, marital status, domestic violence victim status, genetic predisposition or carrier status, or arrest and/or criminal conviction record unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification or other exception.*Application Instructions:  Submit cover letter, CV, ca. twenty-page writing sample, and evidence of teaching effectiveness (e.g., syllabi, student evaluations, faculty observations, teaching philosophy) electronically (standard formats, e.g., Word doc, PDF) via Interview Exchange. Arrange also to have sent electronically three letters of recommendation to: Andrew Scholtz, Search Committee Chair, c/o Margaret Dwyer, Department of Classical and Near Eastern Studies (mdwyer@binghamton.edu).

<li>I question whether or not this is considered an academic position, since it mentions nothing about tenure, teaching, or academic research.  Perhaps we should make a new category for Epi-academic jobs?</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>"publishes and enhances research on GBL collections" would seem to qualify as mentioning research.  Is using collections in research somehow non-academic in your definition?  It involves working with and training students at a university.  But if you think it is beneath "academic" then by all means, don't apply.  Perhaps there should be more jobs like this on this board since there are so few t-t openings relative to the inordinate number of PhDs created. </li>
<li>I agree that this should be here.  I've seen probably a dozen or so jobs like this, but didn't post them.  It is academic in the sense of research, but looking at all the other tenure-track jobs in this category, it is the one that stands out as different by not involving teaching nor tenure, thus my suggestion that it should be here, but we should make a new category and then others might be comfortable adding other jobs the rest of the users hadn't considered.  This isn't a tenure-track position, so should not be in the tenure-track category.  That was my point.  I have no problem with it being on the Wiki and I am applying to these epi-jobs, too.  If you feel so strongly, start a new category and I'll help you fill it with job ads.</li>
<li>I also think it would be useful to have someplace to list these kinds of jobs.</li>
<li>Has anyone heard anything about this??? I guess I should just email or call them.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>Not heard anything. End of semester, maybe busy.  Depending on number of applications, that's a lot to go over in your spare time in one month, though I too am getting anxious.</li>
<li>Still nothing, anyone else heard?</li>
<li>I heard secondhand several weeks ago that interviews had been scheduled, but I can't verify that.  My understanding was that this search was supposed to be more or less wrapped up by now, so I would be surprised if the position wasn't already "filled" at this point.  I applied and didn't hear anything - no acknowledgement of my application, etc.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Never heard anything after email the director and being told they hadn't really started a month after the deadline. No rumors heard here, but expect things wrapped up by now.</li></ul></dd></dl>

</h3>
<p>Lake Forest College Department of Sociology and Anthropology invites applications for a tenure-track position in anthropology at the Assistant Professor level beginning August 2014. The ideal candidate will focus on material culture or specialize in historical archaeology or ethnoarchaeology. Applicants should be willing to help build a program in archaeology and should be prepared to teach a variety of courses, including Introduction to Sociology and Anthropology, within an interdisciplinary department. Regional specialty is open. Demonstrated classroom teaching excellence is expected. PhD required. The Department of Sociology and Anthropology is a growing department of more than 75 majors. The department will comprise 3 sociologists and 2 anthropologists committed to the comparative analysis of human societies.
</p>
<p>A highly selective liberal arts college located on Chicago’s North Shore, Lake Forest College enrolls approximately 1,500 students from over 47 states and 78 countries. At Lake Forest College, the quality of a faculty member’s teaching is the most important criterion for evaluation. The College also expects peer-reviewed publications and active participation in the College community. Lake Forest College embraces diversity and encourages applications from women and other members of historically underrepresented groups.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicants should send a letter of application, curriculum vitae, evidence of teaching experience and evaluations, and graduate school transcripts to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="mailto:archaeologistsearch@lakeforest.edu">archaeologistsearch@lakeforest.edu</a>. Letters of application should address teaching experience and philosophy, as well as the candidate’s professional goals in a national liberal arts college which stresses both teaching excellence and continuing scholarship. Please arrange for three letters of reference to be e-mailed to the same address under separate cover. Materials should be addressed to Professor David Boden, Search Committee Chair. Completed applications must be received by October 15, 2013 to receive full consideration for an interview at the AAA meetings in Chicago.</li>
<li>Received confirmation of application receipt via email (10/14/13)</li>
<li>According to the Chronicle survey, average pay for assistant professors here is 57,000 ... doesn't that seem, well, low, for a Chicago suburb where median individual income is $77K (per Wikipedia)? Anyone know anything about this institution?
<ul>
<li>I certainly got into this job for the earning potential.  I'm with you.  Let's not apply.  Sorry, that was snarky, but I stand by it.  It seems that most starting positions range from $40-55K, so this doesn't seem that out of step to me.  The $77K figure is related to the relatively well-to-do nature of the area surrounding LFC.  Yes it is a city and expensive.  Yes institutions can probably low-ball us (I interviewed for a VAP paying $24k) because of the few jobs and many applicants.  Right now they have us over the barrel.  My sister-in-law went here and loved it (anecdotal, I know).</li>
<li>I thought that was a legit, open-ended question, and your answer confirms my feeling that we should be aware of, and perhaps leery of, lowballing institutions. A TT position is expected to do service, both to the institution and the community, but if we realistically couldn't live in the community, there seems to be a fundamental flaw somewhere. Anonymous Internet snark-shade to the tune of "move along, prole" doesn't seem very helpful. And yes, I've applied, and yes, I wrote the first question.</li>
<li>US Average income is $55k. My point is that income should only be a part of the calculus in any potential job.  This is a small liberal arts teaching position, not top-ranked research or ivy.  $50k seems reasonable to me, not low, even in Chicago.  Rural schools are often in the $40s.  You wouldn't have the biggest house on the block, but you could certainly live near Lake Forest.  Zillow shows plenty of houses in the 100-200k range.  I think abnormally low salaries are a red flag, sure, but this doesn't seem to be abnormally low.  My comment was not helpful, but I don't think comparing a professorship to median income in a pretty wealthy suburb helps either.</li>
<li>55,000/9=6,111.11, 6,111.11*12=73,333.33</li>
<li>Anthropology programs are definitely not at the mean or above on these rankings. I had a job where the avg pay was listed much higher than what I got paid. I imagine this school is definitely in the 40s, maybe very low 50s. Honestly, like I said, anthropologists get paid poorly, even at some very prestigious places with PhD programs. I know someone who started at a southern school with an ivy league rep, and she makes 56 K a year. Chicago is far less expensive that Boston, San Fran, NYC, and many other places. You can still get decent 1-2 bedroom places between 800-1200 a month in cool neighborhoods. The food and drink is no more than elsewhere. Plus, Chi-town is a cool place to be in general. This sounds like a cool job, but it is probably a 4:4. But if your into teaching, and the rate your teaching more than your pubs, it would be a god job.</li>
<li>Be sure you are aware that some schools use the CUPA data for salaries, not the AAUP survey (which I believe is what the Chronicle of Higher Ed uses). CUPA averages can be a little lower. I realize you just want to get an interview first, but thinking about how to best negotiate starting salaries isn't a bad thing. Just landing a job is great. But don't stop there. Your starting base salary dictates all other raises you receive. So, when you start out low, it shapes where you go salarywise. If that matters to you, do your best to get paid as much as you can. Assembling good data on current salaries at the institution (not just average, but range) is helpful. I was first offered 55k at my position. I argued for 60k based on AAUP and what others were getting paid, and they went for 59k (which by the way is the average at my institution). They did low ball me, and part of their argument was the low cost of living. I had to make a case for getting paid the average! If it's expensive to live around the institution, that should be an argument you can make for more pay. You are limited somewhat if the institution cares about salary compression. Just know that if you make it to an offer, negotiation is necesary, and expected. But also know that most of us don't make that much money. Just some food for thought that I hope helps.</li>
<li>The community college 20 minutes up the street from Lake Forest College starts their Ph.D. faculty at 61K, has salary increases each year, a scale that tops out around 120K and just has a three year tenure process. Just saying. The real worry about a position in Illinois is the soon-to-collapse state pension system. You can expect to put in 3% more per paycheck in the near future, further depressing your take home pay. Proposals being floated currently include making new employees under 40 work until they are 72. I realize people don't have many options these days but, if you did, I'd be wary of Illinois.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Looks like the ad was changed. On the AAA website it now mentions everything needs to be in by October 25th and mentions a different email address: "Applicants should send a letter of application, curriculum vitae, evidence of teaching experience and evaluations, and graduate school transcripts to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="mailto:soansearch@lakeforest.edu">soansearch@lakeforest.edu</a>. Letters of application should address teaching experience and philosophy, as well as the candidate’s professional goals in a national liberal arts college which stresses both teaching excellence and continuing scholarship. Please arrange for three letters of reference to be e-mailed to the same address under separate cover. Materials should be addressed to Professor David Boden, Search Committee Chair. Completed applications must be received by <b>October 25, 2013</b> to receive full consideration for an interview at the AAA meetings in Chicago."</li>
<li>That's good (the new email address).  My referees had their letters bounced using the other email address. </li>
<li>Incidentally, that Lake Forest site still says October 15th (as of 10-12-13).
<ul><li>The Lake Forest website still has Oct. 15 as the due date, but it also has the NEW email address. Both the SAA website and the AAA website have the new email and the new date. Did someone at Lake Forest simply forget to change that one piece of info on their own website? Maybe- but it's better to be safe than sorry. Funny- if any of us made this kind of mistake on our cover letter or CV, our application would get tossed in the garbage immediately.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>AAA Interview requested (11/14) (x3)</li>
<li>Had interview.  The interviewers were very nice and it seems like a great dept.  Good luck, everyone!</li>
<li>Any word on this??
<ul><li>Had a phone interview. They said they were going to decide before the holidays and do campus interviews in February. Haven't heard anything by 1/27, so figure I didn't make the cut. (x2)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>There are three historical archaeology talks listed on their online calendar for February and March, so I think it's a safe bet that they really have moved on to their top three for campus interviews (2/24)</li>

<p>The Natural History Museum of Utah (NHMU) and the department of Anthropology at the University of Utah invite applications for a tenure-track joint position as Curator of Archaeology and Assistant Professor of Anthropology beginning July 1, 2014. The majority of this split appointment is funded by the Museum and retention, promotion and tenure decisions will be made according to the department criteria. Candidates must have a completed Ph.D. by time of appointment. The successful candidate will maintain a strong field-and collections-based research program involving students. Duties also include overseeing the curation and continued development of the Anthropology collections, teaching one formal course per year in the Department of Anthropology, participating in Museum public programs and exhibit development, supervising graduate students in the Department, as well as participating in departmental governance. NHMU has recently moved to a new, state of the art facility in Research Park at the University of Utah. This move allowed for inspecting, reorganization, and completion of the database for this remarkable collection of artifacts ranging from some of the earliest artifacts in the Great Basin (Danger Cove) to modern Navajo baskets. Numbering nearly one million objects, the Anthropology collections relate primarily to the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau. Candidates must have a strong record of research and publication in the prehistory of western North American, with preference for work in the Great Basin or prehistoric Southwest; some research must be Utah based. Research focus is open, but preference will be given to applicants cognizant of the research potential of the collections, and whose work will support graduate student training and produce significant extramural support. Candidates that complement the strong evolutionary perspective of current faculty in the Department are especially encouraged to apply.

<p>Peace Corps Response (www.peacecorps.gov/response)
</p>
<p><b>Description:</b>
</p>
<p>The community of Perquín (pop. 4,000, located in northeastern
El Salvador near the Honduran border) is seeking an archaeologist or an expert
with extensive archaeological training to complement a tourism project
currently in progress and under the direction of the Perquín Alcaldía.
</p>
<p>The aim of the tourism project is to rescue and preserve the
historical and cultural patrimony (ca. 1000 BC–present) of the Lenca people native
to the region surrounding Perquín. An important part of this process will be
the identification and exploration of Lenca archaeological sites in the Perquín
area. Several sites with stone existing ruins and adobe structures or other vestiges
(principally pictographs) have been discovered nearby, notably at “El Reloj”
(Mozote) and “El Sendero Escondido” (Guacamaya), but many other sites likely
exist, and the known sites have not yet been systematically explored.
</p>
<p>The PCRV would be working alongside two very distinguished
Salvadoran experts—Ricardo Lindo Fuentes, internationally known writer,
painter, historian and noted expert on cave paintings, of the Secretariat of Culture,
and archaeologist Marcelo Perdomo Barraza of the Salvadoran Academy of History.
The team would work together to determine the extent of the archaeological
evidence present in the Perquín area and, pending ministerial approval, begin
exploration of one or more sites. During the project the PCRV would transfer
his/her knowledge and skills—among them recognition of potential sites,
protection of sites, solicitation of permissions to explore sites and proper
techniques for investigating and excavating sites—to Salvadoran counterparts, and
together they would develop a work plan that would allow the Salvadoran team to
continue with the project following the PCRV’s one-year stay in Morazán.
</p>
<p>The PCRV would also work with Rolando Cáceres, Director of
Perquin´s Museum of the Revolution, and a team of university students from the
University of El Salvador-San Salvador and the University of El Salvador-San Miguel,
in the exploration of sites. Cáceres is training a group of young local men and
women who will provide guide services to tourists in the future and Cáceres and
his group will accompany the PCRV and Salvadoran team in the field since many
sites are remote and trails are nonexistent or not well marked. A group of
Tourism students from the Technological Institute “Segundo Montes” will also
participate in the project and perform a similar role.
</p>
<p>Near the end of the PCRV’s service, the PCRV and the
Salvadoran team will participate in a forum organized by PADECOMSM and the City
Hall of Perquín, whose purpose will be to inform the public, scientists,
students and representatives of the Salvadoran government about the results of
the archaeological investigation and increase awareness of the project
nationally and internationally to encourage funding from the government and/or
universities and NGOS to facilitate the continuation and expansion of the
project.
</p>
<p>The goals of the PCRV’s study, the goals of the Alcaldía's
tourism project, and the historical and cultural vision of the host institution
coincide in the following shared aims:
</p>
<p>·        
To identify and document local sites with
vestiges of the presence of a pre-Colonial Lenca population
</p>
<p>·

<p><b>Two-Year Non-Renewable F. L. Kay Postdoctoral Fellowship in classical archaeology and chemistry</b>
</p>
<p>The Department of Classical Studies and the Department of Chemistry at Brandeis University invite applications for a two-year, non-renewable Florence Levy Kay Postdoctoral Fellowship in classical art and archaeology and chemistry beginning Fall 2014. We seek a scholar who has advanced training in classical art and archaeology, classical studies, and chemistry, is experienced and active in archaeological fieldwork, especially the period of Greek and Roman antiquity, and who has expertise in chemical analyses of ancient objects with the latest archaeological methods. The Fellow, who will be appointed as a faculty member at the rank of Lecturer with a joint appointment in Classical Studies and Chemistry, will teach one course per semester.
</p>
<p>The candidate should be able to offer viable courses both in Classical Studies and in Chemistry. We welcome a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, especially from those who can bridge chemistry and classical archaeology. Ph.D. should be in hand by the commencement of the fellowship, and preferably received within the past ten years. Extensive teaching experience (in classical studies, chemistry, and in the humanities) is strongly desired, since a part of the responsibilities of the Fellowship involves engagement with Brandeis undergraduate and graduate students. The Fellow will contribute to the vibrant intellectual communities of Classical Studies and Chemistry; interdisciplinary connections and mentoring are strongly encouraged. A summer field project in 2015 that incorporates student research would be particularly welcome.
</p>

<p>Duties: The successful candidate, Anthropology Professor, will be required to develop and prepare lessons; instruct, assess and grade student achievement in the sub-field of archaeology. Besides two lower-level courses-Introductory Anthropology: Physical Anthropology /Archaeology (ANTH 111) and Archaeology (ANTH 213)-the successful candidate must be able to teach Archaeology of the Pacific Northwest (ANTH 449), with other upper-level courses in rotation. Area and methodological specialties are open, but preference is for someone with ethnological experience with the Pacific Northwest and topical interests that complement existing faculty strengths. Since this is a small department, breadth is needed. See the VIU department webpage <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://www.viu.ca/anthropology/index.asp">http://www.viu.ca/anthropology/index.asp</a> for course descriptions and program information.
</p>
<p>All faculty must contribute to the life and work of the Department as outlined below. Candidates must demonstrate commitment to teaching, learning and student success through scholarship and institutional service. Successful candidates will participate in a wide range of activities outside the classroom, including student support; institutional, faculty and departmental committee meetings and other initiatives; and professional activities in keeping with their disciplines in and outside the institution. This regular, part-time appointment will be made effective August 01, 2014.
</p>
<p>Required Qualifications: A doctoral degree (or ABD) in anthropology, with a specialization in archaeology, from an appropriately accredited institution; recent experience and expertise teaching undergraduates; record of engagement in scholarly activities; and/or relevant professional memberships. The successful candidate will have a strong commitment to undergraduate teaching and student learning, interest in interdisciplinary scholarship, demonstrated competency working effectively in a team-oriented environment and will be responsive to diverse learning styles, and cultural and academic backgrounds. Preferred Qualifications: PhD completed. Preference will be given to candidates whose research complements and extends the department's current strengths.

<ul>
<li>Application Information: The posting period for this career opportunity, competition #13-4079, will remain open until <b>November 06, 2013</b>. Please Submit: CV/Resume; Cover Letter; Copies of transcripts/credentials/qualifications; Name and contact information for three people willing to provide a reference; Teaching Evaluations; Statement of Teaching Philosophy; Statement of Research Interests and Plans. Short-listed candidates must provide original transcripts, or applicable original certifications at time of interview. Vancouver Island University supports an online application system.

Requests for information or assistance can be directed to recruit@viu.ca.</li>
<li>This is called "Regular Part-Time."  I taught in Canada near BC last year and they paid adjuncts, or "sessionals," at a much better rate than in the States.  For example, if a faculty member teaching a 4:4 load made $50k, adjuncts were paid $12.5k per class.  This was just at the place I was teaching and I don't know if it holds true for VIU.  Also, BC is VERY pro-internal promotion (strong unions) and it is hard to get hired in at a higher level without starting at the basement.  If you are looking to move to Vancouver, this might be a good foot in the door for future employment.</li>

<li>FYI: This position is a continuing contract position, not tenure track.  The entire university is set up on that system.  I am attaching a few links describing this <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://tbo.com/news/education/scotts-questions-put-university-tenure-under-scrutiny-259990">here</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2010/apr/13/pay-issues-lack-tenure-straining-fgcu-faculty-prof/">here</a>, and some former employees <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Florida-Gulf-Coast-University-RVW2843431.htm">reviews</a>.  These pessimistic reviews from within and without are something worth thinking about.  Assistant professors make $47-51k.</li>
<li>Is this the same position that was advertised a year or two ago, but got canceled (I think due to a lack of funding)? I also seem to remember a high teaching load with it (4/4?).</li>
<li>Don't know about the teaching load, but yes, it was advertised in almost the same way and last time was pulled ~ December (I suspect budgetary issues).</li>
<li>I got contacted for a short phone interview on 12/2 (anyone else get contacted or hear anything?)</li>
<li>Contacted for campus visit (1/9).</li>
<li>Job has been offered and accepted. Have secondhand info that the search committee was not impressed with its interviewees.
<ul>
<li>Is this supposed to be somehow helpful? At best, it doesn't seem like a very collegial thing to repeat in a public forum. At worst, it sounds like you mean to humiliate all the candidates.</li>
<li>Sounds like a spurned applicant to me. This nasty sewing circle mentality is unfortunately becoming all too common as chances dwindle. The SAA meetings are like a breeding ground for unproductive gossip.</li>
<li>I think that comment is unproductive and misguided. If the search committee was unhappy, they either did a bad job screening applications or they had very unrealistic expectations. Considering the plethora of applications on the job market, there are plenty of fantastic candidates empty-handed right now. It's demoralizing for me to think they hired someone they were unhappy with just to avoid continuing the search. How is the person who was hired supposed to feel?</li>
<li>Yeah, this is a wiki for disseminating information. Not a wiki for disseminating information that might make someone feel bad! Who cares if it's true or not? If it shows that a department didn't do a good job, or if it hurts someone's feeling, let's pretend the information doesn't exist.</li>
<li>Yeah, as an interviewee for this job, that secondhand information was just delightful to hear!</li>

<p>Flagler College invites applications for a full-time faculty position at the rank of Assistant Professor of Anthropology to begin August 2014. Candidates must hold a Ph.D. (or have a documented completion date prior to appointment), demonstrated excellence in teaching, and an active scholarly agenda. Preference will be given to candidates with a strong background in archaeology, an area expertise in the Southeastern United States, and a secondary interest in cultural anthropology. The ideal candidate will have an interest in and ability to develop field based archaeological research.<br>Responsibilities include teaching introductory and upper-level undergraduate courses, contributing to the first year program, student advising, and committee assignments.
</p>
<p>Candidates must demonstrate an ability to teach a range of anthropology courses, and creativity in linking academia with field-work. The successful candidate will be expected to make significant contributions to the growth and development of the current anthropology minor, support the public history and international studies programs, and work collaboratively with archaeologists in the St. Augustine region. Preferred candidates will be able to teach the following courses: Cultural Anthropology, Archaeology, Physical Anthropology, and Historical Archaeology. Salary and benefits are commensurate with experience.<br>Flagler College is a private independent college with an enrollment of 2,500. The College is located in historic St. Augustine, Florida, 35 miles south of Jacksonville and 55 miles north of Daytona Beach.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicants should send a letter of application, curriculum vitae, a brief statement of teaching philosophy and research goals, evidence of teaching effectiveness, a brief description of proposed courses, unofficial copies of transcripts, three letters of recommendation with contact information, and other supplementary materials to Dr. Alan Woolfolk, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Flagler College, at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://www.flagler.edu/departments/human-resources/jobs/job.html">http://www.flagler.edu/departments/human-resources/jobs/job.html</a>. Review of completed applications will begin March 21 and continue until the position is filled.</li>
<li>Has anyone else looked at this application process? It is through GovernmentJobs.com, and since they request three letters of recommendation, it appears that we are to get the letters of recommendation delivered to us before submitting them. There is also no contact information for HR or for questions, unless I'm missing something?</li>
<li>I'm baffled by the wording as well. It says all materials should be sent to this VP, then the link points to the GJ application site. I started the process, and it *appears* that you only need to supply reference contact information (I haven't completed the process yet). Really sick of all the outsourcing of applications that's going on. (2/18/14)
<ul>
<li>Glad it's not just me - the application process seems to also want you to enter all of your CV/resume information (because this is also a portal for applying to, you know, Government Jobs). I called HR two days ago and haven't heard back (good luck trying to find contact information for them). I also asked if they could please add a contact for questions about the application or position. Here's hoping. (2/18/14)</li>
<li>I posted two back. Completed the application now, and yes, you just enter reference contact information. I ended up adding most of the requirements under "other" documents -- this was a painful and protracted process.</li>
<li>Thanks for the update - I'm still waiting on a response to my question (to two different places at Flagler) re: whether they really do want letters at this stage, and if they really want them from us. Your having completed the process - and sharing with the rest of us - is very helpful (and I can tell my references to relax!).</li>
<li>Received email request for *me* to have references send letters via email. It noted "the screening process has already begun." (3/3/14) (x2)</li>
<li>Just wanted to add that this process for sending recommendation letters is different from what is inferred from the job ad - so, as you apply, you will fill in the names and contact information for references. Once you submit the application, you should receive an email confirming receipt and asking you to have references submit letters to a specific email address. (So don't wait until the last minute to submit - also because, as noted above, apparently review of applications has already begun.)</li>
<li>One note, this is NOT a tenure track position. It is an infinitely renewable contract position, so it may be in the wrong place on this wiki. Second, I applied earlier this week and received the application confirmation email immediately. But nothing since. Does the email to forward references follow shortly after the confirmation? I would like to get my ref writers as much time as possible.</li>
<li>All continuing-contract positions, like Florida Gulf Coast University and this one, are in this category since they do not have a set end date, as opposed to the limited-term category below.  Thank you for pointing that out, though, since the job advertisement is mute on the subject.  It does seem like there is a correlation: the worse the position, the worse the application process and organization.  So many limited-term positions ask for up-front letters.</li>
<li>Huh, that's interesting. Flagler did ask for the same materials last time this job was advertised (three years ago). They have quite a few faculty who stay, but it's true that it is not TT, and I think it is annual contracts.</li>
<li>Phone interview scheduled (3/31). FYI, request came by email (x2)</li>
<li>Invitation for campus interview (4/8).</li>
<li>Offer made and accepted (5/20).</li>
</ul>

<li>This wording is confusing--do they want the teaching portfolio as part of the initial application?</li>
<li>Good question, not sure either, but I presume that a teaching portfolio is included in the initial application....anyone else know anything about this one?</li>
<li>Agreed-very poorly worded and confusing. If the portfolio is to be submitted from the start along with the other materials, why not just clearly say so? </li>
<li>I have specific knowledge of this: all applicants need a teaching portfolio plus letter, CV, and reference names in the initial application. Please submit all materials!</li>
<li>Heard through the grapevine that HR changed the ad's wording so that things ended up in this confusing order.  As if it wasn't already hard enough to guess what departments are looking for!</li>
<li>Anyone heard if there's been any movement on this one yet?</li>
<li>Negative (though I would have only heard from here), but it does seem slow if they plan to hire by January</li>
<li>Heard from a friend that they started interviewing for this position last week (10/7), though her info may be jumbled up with another job search... so I wouldn't take this as absolute truth. </li>

<li>I assume this is wrapped up?</li>
<li>Looks like it; job offer was made and accepted.</li>
<li>I finally received my formal rejection letter from NAU. It was very nicely worded. But THEY MISSPELLED MY NAME IN THE ADDRESS SECTION, AND THEN PUT THE WRONG NAME IN THE SALUTATION. Whoops. Now I know who at least one other rejectee is. ; )</li>

<p>The Department of Anthropology and the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania invite applications from archaeologists with qualifications in the prehistory of North America.  The appointment will be at the rank of tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department and as an Assistant Curator in the American Section of the Museum, starting Fall 2014.  The Department of Anthropology and the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology are strongly committed to Penn's Action Plan for Faculty Diversity and Excellence and to establishing a diverse faculty (for more information see:   <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v58/n02/diversityplan.html">http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v58/n02/diversityplan.html</a>). 
</p>
<p>Applicants should have a strong interest in theory, cultural complexity, the American Sections collections, and public education, as well as plans for active field research involving students. The successful candidate will be involved in: (1) the development of undergraduate and graduate curricula in archaeology within the context of an anthropology program that encourages dialogue across the subfields as well as between disciplines; and (2) the ongoing activities of the Penn Museum related to research, teaching, and public outreach.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Review of applications will begin <b>November 15, 2013</b> and will continue until the position is filled. Interested candidates should apply at  <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://facultysearches.provost.upenn.edu/postings/70">http://facultysearches.provost.upenn.edu/postings/70</a> . Include a letter of application, a current CV, and the names and contact information of four individuals who will supply written references. The University of Pennsylvania is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity Employer. </li>
<li>Since I've been on the market, I have gotten in the habit of applying for places even though I don't work in the specified region. The reasoning is a hopeful naiveté that my caliber will make them say, "wait a minute! hold yer horses! look at this guy! let's hire him instead, give him tenure, and a macarthur award!" Yea, I know. You don't need to mention it. Plus, it has increased the number of places to which I apply each year, making me feel like I am accomplishing something. So here is my question. Just how North American do they want a candidate to be. What about Meso, if the person works in Mexico which is technically N. America. Anyone have insider info so I don't waste my time? Usually it is a waste of time, but given shifts over at UPenn, I wonder if they might be more open to a wider array of applicants.
<ul>
<li>I have it on good authority that a North American (i.e., US) focus is preferred, but they would be open to reading/potentially considering an aplication from a Meso person. Also, here's a link to info on the American section at the museum, which does include collections from both North and South America <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://www.penn.museum/about-our-collections/american-section.html">http://www.penn.museum/about-our-collections/american-section.html</a>
</li>
<li>That is interesting, as they also request research interests in "cultural complexity."  Fingers crossed that my area is "complex" enough...</li>
<li>Request for letters sent to references (11/7x3)
<ul>
<li>Interesting, since the deadline of Nov. 15 hasn't hit yet.  The wording is ambiguous, are all applicants' references being contacted?  Did anybody apply at least more than one week ago (to give them processing time) and NOT get a request for references?</li>
<li>It's not that uncommon for places to ask for references from likely prospects before the deadline.  In the cases I've seen, not everyone was contacted (though I don't know anything about this job).</li>
<li>I suspect this is a broadcast request for references.  My experience with schools that use this system is that as soon as you submit an auto-email is generated to your references. Though all 3 sent on the same day is odd.</li>
<li>This was not an auto-email sent as soon as the application was submitted in this case.</li>
<li>My references all received automated requests for letters shortly after the application was submitted. It seems the system is requesting letters for all applicants. (x3) (I agree- applied on 11/15, references received request for letters 11/18.) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a letter-writer, I got two (count em, two) requests for letters for each of the applicants I write letters for. Deadlines for the letters were not mentioned, and no indication of the status of applicants for which letters were requested. I queried both emails contained in the request (for deadline, for the status of these applicants, and for the reason for duplicate requests), but no one has bothered to reply. I am sympathetic to the job-seekers who have to put up with the nonsense and bullshit of current academic searches. Penn thinks they have a high repulation, but poor procedures like this don't help their cause.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On campus interview requested (12-24) x2</li>
<li>An offer has been made (2/27)</li>
<li>Offer accepted (3/6)</li>
<li>Offer has been accepted for months now, I applied and still have never recieved a word about the status of the job. What a joke.</li>
<li>I agree. This search reflects badly on Penn's department.</li>

<p>The Department of Anthropology and the South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology (SCIAA) invite applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor in anthropological archaeology specializing in the southeastern United States. Applicants must have demonstrated abilities in external funding, publishing and research, and teaching. The position will begin in August 2014, and the candidate will be expected to hold the Ph.D. at the time of appointment.
</p>
<p>SCIAA (www.artsandsciences.sc.edu/sciaa) is a university research institute and state cultural resource management agency with a rich history of fostering research on the archaeology of the southeastern U.S. The Department of Anthropology (www.cas.sc.edu/anth) is a four-field program offering B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees, with a particular strength in historical archaeology. Preference will be given to applicants who are pursuing innovative theoretical directions in Archaic and Woodland studies, but who also have a history of working in multiple time periods. Because SCIAA has a mandate to educate citizens about the history and archaeology of South Carolina, the successful candidate will be expected to develop a long-term research project in the state if they do not already have one. We seek someone with methodological strengths in either landscape, lithic or ceramic analysis.
</p>
<p>The new assistant professor will have a tenure home in Anthropology but will have research and service duties divided between Anthropology and SCIAA. Teaching responsibilities will include undergraduate and graduate coursework and mentoring. SCIAA and Anthropology are strongly committed to collaborative efforts at the university. Scholars will thus have an outstanding opportunity to interact with a wide variety of departments, institutions, research programs, and individuals.

<p>For those of you who are on, or who have been on search committees, what is your "rejection etiquette"? As a potential candidate who's been on the market for three years now, I've noticed a wide range of "rejection behavior" from various search committees. I've received some letters right off the bat, within a couple days of the deadline. Sometimes, it's May or June,and I randomly get a letter from some job I applied to back in October. I've also never received letters at all. This range is inclusive of jobs where I've made the first round of cuts.  Why do some committees not send letters until after they've completed the hire? Are they afraid their preferred candidate will say no, and they'll be left in the learch? But isn't that why they bring 2-3 people for campus interviews? Why make the rest of us "chumps" wait in the dark until they've locked things down? Often, as job searchers, we have several stirrers in the pot, including post-doc, VAP, adjuncting, CRM, etc., and we need to know in a timely manner if we need to pursue one of those other opportunities with more vigor. This is not trivial; it often requires us to move our entire families across the country! We need time to plan that, and we owe it to our families to let them know of these things with enough time. I honestly think it's incredibly rude of search committees to drag their heels on these things.
</p>
<p>Personally, speaking as a potential job candidate, I would prefer a "two stage" rejection approach. Send rejection letters immediately after making the first round cuts, thanking them, but letting them know that it's a real long-shot for them. Then, send another round immediately after the second-round cuts, letting them know that they haven't been asked for a campus interview, but that there is a small chance that they may be contacted again in the coming month or two. This is, IMO, an honest and fair approach, that allows both parties to move forward, without compromising any contingencies that may occur. The question is, why isn't this approach standard? Thoughts?
</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not - and have not been - on a search committee, but I agree that it is in very poor regard to applicants not to alert them of an immediate or subsequent rejection, even more so for people who have made the long or short lists. I understand waiting to send rejection letters to remaining short-listed candidates until a contract is signed by the selected candidate, but I think it reflects a terrible disregard for applicants not to alert them of their status. And, yes, search committee members, I understand that being on a search committee is an additional duty on top of a heavy workload - but do you remember how much work you spent on an application, assuming you really wanted the job and tailored it appropriately? Receiving a form letter rejection in a timely manner is better than not receiving notification at all. And, let's be honest, it wouldn't really be the search committee sending the letters, right?</li>
<li>One thing I learned once I got my first TT job and served on search committees is that lot of things that famously suck- like reference letters up front or rejection conventions- are entirely HR rules and have nothing to do with the search committee or the department. Occasionally very senior people heading search commmittees will buck tradition to be more considerate but the rest of us are under penalty of death.
<ul>
<li>Does anyone know <i>why</i> this is a policy of some HR departments? Clearly it is not universal, so I wonder why some HR rules would stipulate this, and others would not? Is it somewhere in various state laws? Or just an institution by institution thing? If so, is it something that could be changed? How? As the academic job market gets increasingly unfriendly (let's be honest, it is), are these tacticts becoming more common? Should we try to change this?</li>
<li>I'm not sure about how univeral things are but, at my place, changing this policy (assuming people wanted to ) would involve sitting on several committeees for at least several months, getting everything approved by Faculty Senate, then administration, etc, with a lot of back and forth. It would literally take years and lots of frustrating work. And I'm not in the mood because we probably won't hire another anthropologist for 15 years (unless I leave). The logic behind letters up front is that search committees can move faster because they don't have to wait for additional materials (increasingly important for the spring term searches). The logic behind the boilerplate and very late rejections (or sometimes none at all) is to keep not-so-bright faculty members from divulging details that might get the institution sued (e.g. we were always doing to hire my buddy's old advisee). To get it all changed, one has to sell the changes as ones that will save the institution time or money. Being considerate or humane doesn't register in this buyers' market... unfortunately.</li>

<p>I think it would be useful to post the names of people who actually get the jobs on the Wiki after the searches are completed.  Is there a reason we don't do so on this Wiki?  It is easy enough to suss out a few months later by looking at the websites of relevant departments.  Posting the names of big winners would not only sate my curiosity, but also could provide formative feedback to other unsuccessful applicants, allowing them to look at who is getting hired and think about why.  Just an idea...
</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not opposed to it in principle, but I worry that in practice it will open the floor to ad hominim an mulierem (sic?) attacks (e.g., "I can't believe John Dough got this job, he is a real jerk!").  I'm easy and will go where ever the winds of the wiki members blow.</li>
<li>I'd error on the side of caution with this in favor of anonymity--you wouldn't want any legal action directed at members or the site if some sort of incident happened prior to a hiring.</li>
<li>Perhaps it would be safe to name names only if the school openly identifies the successful candidate in the rejection letter (like Truman State did this year), on an official department or university website, or in print?  Then we are simply citing information we are not responsible for publishing.  To the origional poster: one tip I've used is to look at recent hires in the department to get a feel for what that school views as "successful candidate material."  That way you can use the information for your application, instead of waiting till afterwards to know what they were looking for.  Then again, sometimes hiring seems to be based on the same decision-making process outlined in South Park <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/222638/bailout">here</a>. (&lt;=Like)</li>
<li>I collected information on job-getters over the past couple of years. Typically 2-4 publications at least in press, with one accepted in a "name" journal. And I mean peer-reviewed (stop trying to call your excavation report or SAA presentation a "publication") Teach 3-4 different courses solo,including at least outside of our subfield and ideally one which is a specialization or upper division class (with rave student evals). It helps to have received an external grant and served on a committee. In an ideal world, every grad program would require these conditions to graduate. Be teaching at a comparable or higher ranked instituion than the one you are applying to. Have an active post-diss project ongoing (not just a good idea), not just a continuation of the diss but something novel and make certain it involves students in really obvious ways. There seems to be a slight preference for shiny, new graduates less than three years out that I cannot explain (wouldn't you want someone proven?). This might be related to offering low salaries.This is all UNLESS you've been entirely adjuncting it for years, in which case some search committees unfairly begin to see you as damaged goods. Oddly enough, having too many publications or years and years of yearching experience can start to work against you after a while, pegs you as too much of a specialist for some assistant prof positions. It bears repeating, in the past three years ~25% of these jobs did go insiders and I'd guesstimate another 20% went to people with the "right" connections (particularly postdocs or visiting positions). There are clear exceptions to any and all of this from time to time, but that's the common CV I identified. Too many people are graduating in this market without one pub, without just one solo class competed (let alone a teaching portfolio), heck, even some people are somehow coming out without any fieldwork experience at all. Those grad departments should be shamed.
<ul>
<li>I agree with most of that except I think a postdoc or VAP has become almost obligatory. What grad student is graduating with their new project already started, especially if one is getting out in the shorter amount of time that admins are pushing (5-6 years to defense instead of 7-9 years)?</li>
<li>Not many P.I. or dirt archaeologist types in my opinion. I think specialists (XRF, botanicals, zooarch, bioarch, etc.) have an advantage here, at least in the first five years out. Good ones (or at least those who are bright and who work in active areas of the world) are plugged into several things at once and often into projects with current permits and piles of material collected and awaiting analysis. I think it is easier to "sell" that situation as a developed post-diss project and I think that is possibly why, when I took back at the successful people in the last few years, I keep seeing these these specializations. I should note that I work internationally, this may not apply as clearly to the North American crowd where I speculate the ability to offer a local field school might be a stronger draw.</li>
<li>I don't know if there is a set of characteristics that are common among successful applicants.  Sometimes being a specialist might be seen as an advantage, but in other cases having one's own project that is student-friendly might be better, no?  Plus, even having all of the above-mentioned feathers in one's cap doesn't guarantee a job in any way.  I know I am getting more attention this year because my letter is much better, even though my stats haven't changed drastically.  If there was one right way to do this, or a magic formula that guaranteed a job, we would not need this Wiki.  My advisor told me that having an active field project (not a continuation of one's dissertation), publications, teaching experience, and a relatively short graduate school tenure were the best predictors of success on the job market.  Of course I think his advice comes from a pre-recession mindset.  Of all his students, the ones that have those four things are the ones getting interviews, though.  What we need are real statistics instead of anecdotes.  If I have free time, maybe I'll go back to last year's Wiki and check those departments who hired and tabularize the CVs of successful candidates.  "Free time" being the operative phrase.  Data!</li>
<li>I think a lot comes down to luck.  I have many of the things going for me mentioned above (first author pubs in good journals, an 'in demand' specialty, a good cover letter (so I've been assured), lots of professional presentations, tons of teaching experience with stellar student evals, a post-doc, a current VAP, a large, on-going research project that involves students in multiple ways, a good reputation in the field with research that has been very well received, etc) and in the past 3 years, I've gotten exactly one phone interview.  Folks on my committee and other colleagues are all scratching their heads as to why I haven't gotten any more interest.  I think it all comes down to luck.  Most of us are so specialized that departments can really pick and choose exactly what they're looking for.  You can do all the right things and not get anywhere on the job market if the right department doesn't offer the right job.  The only 'universal' advice I've been given is that once you're 4 or 5 years post PhD, your chances of getting a job decrease rapidly because you are seen as 'stale.'</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not a big fan of posting names...although it seems fair to look 'em up later if you think it will help. I feel like data on the lottery winners isn't really helpful though. Judging from what folks have posted above most folks seem to have a good idea of what makes a solid profile. I would surmise that the top 20-25 percent of candidates per job look pretty similar (with only a few outliers) in terms of their profile of pubs, classes, research without taking the elusive "fit" or "specialty trend" into account. The huge issue as I am sure we are all aware of is the absolute size of N (N=number of applicants). You could be doing everything right but with a sufficiently large N you may be in the top 10-20 percent (or less!) and still not make the long list. The size of N these days means that even top candidates have a lower probability of obtaining that TT job. Of course, you can always improve your profile but it bears repeating that until the jobs increase to the point that N is smaller, you may only be increasing your probabilities by depressingly low amounts. I do recognize that there will be a few candidates who are on everyone's list! But...the numbers mean that even folks I know who (I think) are rockstars have made a lot of lists and still not landed even one job. Statistical reasoning tells me that I shouldn't be surprised and that the sheer numbers data alone means that the CV data, while helpful to tell you what profile you will need, that profile alone is not sufficient to land a TT by an uncomfortably large margin.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think posting names is a good idea either.  As someone mentioned above, it would create a hit list in the sense that those who can't handle the rejection will investigate the successful candidate searching for fault that makes them feel better.  It is common among people at all levels of education.  Academics are not above the fray and the more competitive it gets out there the worse it will be.  If you didn't get a job you applied for, look it up on your own or, better, ask the search committee for <i>feedback</i>.  Regarding the comparative N size of jobs/jobseekers, I am afraid this dire situation will not get better without an unavoidable purge of job seekers into CRM or other disciplines.  All current faculty everywhere are pushed to gain students, majors, and grad students or else face cuts to their department funding.  If the N of jobs increases (which <i>cannot </i>happen without an increase in students enrolled in archaeology for the reasons mentioned above) it won't sufficiently offset the # of seekers.  Currently apps per academic job are around 125:1 on average.  If the number of jobs doubles on a consistent basis (yearly) it will be due to increased enrollement in the discipline, which will further dilute the market.  Not sure if there is a solution, I hope the lottery winners appreciate their situation and stop bitching so much on Facebook about how they hate their students and how they are so busy.
<ul><li>Seeing someone awesome whose accomplishments I could strive to emulate get a job always made me feel better by partially restoring my faith in the system.  Seeing someone whose CV looked unimpressive get one is what made me feel worse-- pretty much the opposite of sour grapes or searching for faults.  Academics have been trained to think we'll succeed if we work hard enough, so having the random element to success thrust in our faces makes "the fray" even worse for us than it is for most people.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Another vote for not posting names.  It's very frustrating to see someone with far fewer publications than you and less teaching experience get a job you thought you fit perfectly, and it happens all the time!  Putting names up on an anonymous wiki would open the winners up to criticism, when the crazy hiring process is not their fault.  Don't hate the player, hate the game...</li>
<li>Nothing is going to change with this process unless it is made entirely transparent. To do so should not be an entry point for disabusing job seekers but rather for holding institutions/departments accountable for their practices. Don't hate the player; hate the game...</li>

<p>The AAA has requested that search committees refrain from asking for letters of recommendation until initial screening of applicants has been completed:

<p>Despite this (at least two year-old request), many institutions persist in requiring letters of recommendation as part of an initial application package.  This places a burden on both the applicant and his/her reviewers and places undue stress on advisor/advisee relationships.  Please list here the names of schools/job posts asking for up-front letters of recommendation so that we may alert the AAA to violations of their request:

Thank you for starting this list.  There have been a number of jobs that I have not applied for because of the burden of receiving letters up front.  It is not only a burden on the applicant, who is expected to bend over backward for a very slim chance of even making the short list, but also for very busy referees.  Mine aren't the kind of references that send the letter immidiately.  I usually have to send several emails and call at least once before they send them.  It makes the applicant feel like a nuisance in these cases, and it can drive the referees to annoyance.  
</p>
<p>It is shocking to me how many places are violating this logical request.  I would think the last thing a search committee would want to do is wade through reference letters up front along with everything else submitted with the application.  They must be trying to save time by asking for them upfront, but it is a waste of everyone's time and seriously NOT COOL.
</p>
<p>I am sure many of these are HR requirements and the search committee members want to read these letters of recommendation as much as our referees want to write them.  In my admittedly minor experience, HR dictates some pretty strict requirements for the job ad and search.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Several universities this year seem to be asking for just reference contact info in their ads, but then sending auto-generated requests for letters to all applicants once their HR website receives an application.  I am guessing these are HR-mandated?  It's an interesting middle ground...</li>
<li>This is really no different from the letter requests that are made in the initial ad.  In fact, this way is even more nefarious, as applicants have no fair warning about the unnecessary request going to their referees. I tend to only apply for a "reach" job if I know my referees won't be bothered for a letter unless I'm on a pared down list. I think Penn and Utah should be added to the above list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Florida Gulf Coast University was removed. After applying, and talking with HR at the achool, I found out that it was not mandatory to supply letters up front (although, both the job advertisement and the online application system made it seem this way). In fact, they are most interested in calling referees (after they make a short list). (x2)  Added note: yes, it was never apparent to me that FGCU asked for letters up front.  They did so the previous year (if I recally correctly), but then the search was cancelled.

<p>Was there a mass retirement in the Classics? Good lord. Anyway, unless things improve in the next month, these are some really grim tidings in terms of the jobs for anth arch. Last year was the best year probably in the past five for offerings. But this year is the worst since I have been looking, which started on the 2008-2009 circuit. Help.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I thought last year was rough, but don't have the history you do.  I did some quick comparison between last year's Wikia page and this one.  Last year, there were seven jobs with deadlines on or before October 1st.  This year we have eight.  Last year we had 25 jobs with deadlines between October 2nd and December 1st.  So far this year we have 25 and that number could still grow.  I don't think comparisons beyond that date will be accurate yet.  Maybe it isn't so grim?  What scared me last year was when plum jobs were getting 300+ applicants and even less desirable ones got hundreds.  I applied for 40+ jobs.  Sure, the system should winnow out the chaff, but jeez.  Best-case scenario means one out of three of us will get a TT job, but it seems more like one out of five or six.</li>
<li>I suppose you're correct in terms of numbers, but did you omit all the Classics jobs (Berkeley, Tenn, Carlton, Loyola M, Old Dom, Wash). But, nonetheless, I was considering a whole range of personally subjective things, like school quality, impact of program, presence of MA or PhD, location, and likely pay rate. The top places this year seem more Classics. Last year were some terrific offerings. The year before that a few nice gems. Same with the years prior to that. For each year since I have been looking, there have been at least a few jobs that folks would call "The ___ Job," with a certain degree of admiration, respect, envy, and, mostly, desperate desire. A couple years back it was "The Chicago Job." Before that, "The Berkeley Job." A couple years before that "The Michigan Job." But there were other, similarly impressive places each of those years. Last year there were a bunch that reached that standing (UNC, WashU, ASU, etc.). Hell, even Vermont, a small-non-grad program dept, was viewed in such a favorable light, mainly because it is a great school generally and, damn, I would love to live there. But, maybe this is totally a biased and jerky view, there aren't programs like that yet for anth arch this year. Maybe SMU. Maybe Toronto (though Canada, like many countries except the United States, puts their own citizens at an advantage on hiring). Maybe Emory, but it is very specialized. Perhaps NAU is the Vermont of this year. They aren't going to hire an archaeologist for the Berkeley race job. The environment jobs at Stanford and Santa Barbara are also not going to hire archaeologists. One should try, yes,but it won't happen. Yes, I have no insider knowledge, I'm just guessing, so maybe I am cyncial for trying to get a job for so many years. But, when taking these things into consideration, omitting jobs in Classics depts, and looking over the past six years, this is the worst one I've seen. It might be a great year for a few folks, but...</li>
<li>Seems like a smaller number of jobs than usual to me too, unless you happen to be in Classics, the Southeast, or bioarchaeology.  I'm afraid the odds of getting these jobs are nowhere near one in three-- many go to people who already have a job but want to move.  Most of those people either don't use the wiki or lurk very, very quietly, so the ratio of admitted wiki-users to jobs is misleading.</li>
<li>If you also check the PhysAnth wikia, the bioarchaeology jobs this year are suprisingly numerous. I am not complaining on that front, but I am waiting for more middle and lower tier schools to start posting positions. Right now it's all great programs (for bioarch) which suggests I won't get any attention as an ABD candidate. I'm fine taking a job at a less prestigeous program to move up to a better program in a few years, but that only works if smaller programs are hiring.
<ul>
<li>There's a catch-22 here; the "less prestigious" programs may not look at you because they know you'll want to move on in a few years, and they want someone who will stay!  I think I am currently having this problem-- I would be happy in a small, teaching-focused department, but I suspect people look at my research and don't believe me.  Sigh...  All the more reason for a draft system!</li>
<li>I have to disagree with you on that somewhat. If you have great research, pubs, grants, etc., but write a letter and present yourself as someone who wants to be at a smaller, less prestigious place or a teaching school, then you will be better off than somebody who submits a research 1 letter to a smaller place. That said, you also have to take into consideration the program and the demography of the program (i.e., avg age of active faculty). Younger profs are more realistic than the baby boomers because they know first hand what the job market has turned into. They are also more idealistic and do not see their "less prestigious" programs as less prestigious. Especially in this climate where getting a job anywhere is like winning an award. All programs want the best people they can get. The only consideration a program might have toward someone looking like they want to leave is that the college might eventually tire of the "floor mat" style of the program and just end the line. If you are applying for a teaching-oriented place, make sure to have a letter that talks all about how you want to be there and teach; let your research accomplishments just speak for themselves.</li>
<li>I also disagree with the idea that smaller teaching colleges will not fairly look at candidates who seem to have research programs and publications that are "above the average." And I have experience to support this claim. My first job was at a small teaching college (though I am hesitant to claim that my research and pubs were/are "above average," the hiring committee certainly thought so). Indeed, the hiring committee and my colleagues told me that they were indeed aware that I may have been treating the job as a stepping stone to an R1 position. But they said that they were willing to take the chance and they thought the students would benefit from someone actively conducting research. I did move on from that job and there were not any bad feelings. When I told a colleague the news that I planned to move elsewhere, he exclaimed: "Great! I've always wanted to work with people who could move to higher positions." So, long story short: Do not assume anything about the smaller colleges. Of course, it is possible that some of them are wary of hires from the "big gun" anthro universities, my experience demonstrates that many of their faculty do not think this way, and are just psyched to hire and work with people who are doing interesting research. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Boy, the job posts have ground to an absolute halt here.  I had hoped early October would have been ripe with November and December deadlines.  Let's hope for a late-season glut of January deadlines or this is going to be absolutely dismal.  I apply for everything I possibly can and have only 13 done so far this year, compared to 17 by this date in 2012.  I've applied to more jobs outside the US than last year as well.  And as mentioned above, nothing seems to be "the" job for this round.  I also agree with the last comment above.  When I got a VAP gig and had to tell the chair of the department where I had been an adjunct, he said, "Great that we were able to have somebody of your caliber for the time we did.  We expect you to move on and up."  Let's hope things pick up soon, either that or you all have unfortunate accidents... hmmm.  No one will ever suspect me
<ul>
<li>Time to pack those bags and move to Australia</li>
<li>Yeah, this is pretty bad.  I'm an old world archaeologist and I've only been able to apply for 7 jobs so far, and none of them are a particularly good fit.</li>
<li>The job market in archaeology has never really recovered. To give you a sense of the scale, folks in my program that graudated in 2004-2007 were applying to 35 or so academic jobs on avarage (full-time but not all TT) that were at least reasonably good fits for them and they got them. I don't think I've met anyone since 2008-9 that can claim more than 16 in any given cycle. Add the a few years backlog of underemployed and highly productive Ph.D.s (given the proliferation of doctoral programs), some of whom are insiders at these advertised positions, and you have what must be the most competitive market in the history of our discipline.</li>
<li>Well, no January glut of deadlines.  Last year almost half of my applications were due in January, this year less than a quarter.  What happened?  Happy New Year and good luck.</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>These articles on not getting into Harvard and Berkeley remind me very much of applying for academic jobs, where we're up against that monster they call "fit" instead of interpretations of a "holistic" application.  <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/29/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/29Rparenting.html">"New York Times: Young, Gifted, and Not Getting Into Harvard"</a>  <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/education/edlife/lifting-the-veil-on-the-holistic-process-at-the-university-of-california-berkeley.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;">"New York Times: Holistic Application Process"</a>  Unfortunately it's hard to find a really satisfying career equivalent to a "safety school" in archaeology.  (If you know of one that combines both teaching and archaeological research into ONE full-time job, please say so!)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>It's an interesting comparison. In my experience, "fit" has a lot to do with the "sexiest" (on paper) candidate the school can get to accept the job and, unfortunately, a lot of things that should be irrelevant - like sex and age (not necessarily translated to experience in teaching or in the field).</li>
<li>Getting a tt job is harder than getting into Harvard. That said, don't think too much into it. There is no rational logic applied or any formula. These are academics making decisions and being forced to serve on committees they don't care that much about. One of the main things is abd. Unless you have made yourself really shine, and I mean really shine (which can be with grants, awards, pubs, demographics, etc), you get cut almost automatically if your are abd. But once you aren't cut from that long list, the abd thing matters less to committees, The only concern the comm might have is that the dean or someone higher up might not approve, but that has got to be rare. Generally, though, most abd folks are just cut flat out. Other than that, the "fit" thing I guess captures what happens. But many committees want more holisticaly trained people anyway. If you can sell yourself as such, both on paper and on person, you will out-shine. And, if you get an interview, a truly more holistic person should just intrinsically do better in conversations, Q and A, etc. On the other hand, in terms of teaching and research combo, that depends on the job and the institution. You can be the best teacher in the history of the place and not get tenured if you do not do enough research. Conversely, if you apply for, say Washington College (which was hiring last year) with a big research letter, you won't get a nibble because you will seem like someone who doesn't want to be there. People want good young and promising scholars with some good teaching experience who are willing to grow. That sounds corny, but it is really true. I wouldn't dwell too much on issues of "fit" because, frankly, they can become self-destructive ways to obsess on individuals' intrinsic qualities and, thus, find easy targets to blame when you don't get an interview or a position. You're somewhat right, especially as some schools have to try to meet particular goals, but not entirely. There is no self-evident hires, if you know what I mean. One of the problems in academics, is that we are trained to work hard and do our best. But we aren't trained to realize that this is a job we are trying to get. People get jobs for all kinds of reasons in other fields, like business, etc. It is not entirely different here. It is somewhat but this is still a job and we aren't entirely hired simply because we have x amount of teaching and a certain number of pubs. Those show that we are promising scholars. But, frankly, there are so few jobs these days that the number of very well published folks without tt jobs is enormous.</li>
<li>I have heard "fit" described in terms of "will this person socialize/get along with the current faculty?" This came from someone who has sat on several search committees.  Publication record counts, teaching record counts, theoretical orientation counts, but a bigger plus than all of these is knowing someone in department, having worked or published with them previously.  Then again, there is not one universal plan that different universities follow for their hiring decisions. That is why so many people refer to fit as an elusive term.  </li>
<li>Focus on the things that are in your control. Much of the interview and hiring process is not in your control. While it might be useful to know how it sometimes works, you can easily spend a lot of precious brain power worrying or strategizing about things hiring committees do that you can't change. That can be exhausting. "Fit" definitely isn't "fair". Use your energy to put concrete things in place that demonstrate that you are awesome. That's all you can do, and there are no guarantees. But maybe you can make the process less emotionally and psychologically draining for yourself.</li>
<li>This is pretty late a post but whatever. I was an undergrad at one school, and I was in grad school at two others. I've been a lecturer at a few places. I'm on my second tt job. One thing that I have noticed since on the tt thing has made me think back on things I saw with new hires when I was a lecturer, a grad student, and even an undergraduate. What is it? The fact that, ultimately, there is very, very, very little effort made by existing faculty, even very senior folks who should be mentors, to create a space that is receptive to the unique contributions that new, junior faculty make. I've seen new people become very isolated and unhappy due to this and I've experienced it myself. Academics are out for themselves.</li>
