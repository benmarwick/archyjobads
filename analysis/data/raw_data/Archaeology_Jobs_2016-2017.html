<li>"the Department continues the Boasian tradition of extended ethnographic research, critical theoretical approaches to contemporary global problems, and language sensitive and historically informed analysis.

Interest in conducting and supervising locally based research is welcomed. UMM emphasizes close student-faculty relationships and faculty-directed student research. An active research program is expected and research collaboration with undergraduates is highly valued.
</p>
<p>Position begins August 14, 2017. Salary and teaching load (20 credits annually) are competitive. ABD will be considered although candidates with strong evidence that the Ph.D. will be completed by the start date are preferred. Evidence of successful prior undergraduate teaching experience is required.

<dl><dd><ul>
<li>I had LORs request and a phone interview, which was quite pleasant. However, in doing additional research prior to the interview, I noticed that one of the current faculty matches the search criteria very closely. It appears on faculty webpage that he is an assistant professor, but the website link states he is a "Lecturer/Teaching Assistant Professor," which sounds far less permanent. So it looked to me that they had an inside candidate. Or perhaps he's moving on. Who knows. I haven't bothered checking the wiki until now. I'm glad I wasn't asked for an on-campus interview, because if this was an internal hire and they were just going through the process I don't need "the practice" or my time wasted. 2/23</li>

<li>For those waiting until last minute and using only job description to get stuff together. THE DESCRIPTION IS INCORRECT. It reads like your cover letter should cover research and teaching, like all cover letters do. No. You must have (1) Cover letter, (2) Research statement, (3) Teaching statement, (4) CV, (5) list of refs. I am so tired of departments requesting these separate statements. They are useless and just added work for both applicants and committees. Not listing them in the job description is an added irritation. Any job not only requesting letter, CV, and list of refs should get blacklisted on the AAA website. Anyway, so much fun to get your letter ready and log in to upload only to find out I have to write a separate research statement.</li>

<p>The MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering seeks to fill a non-tenure track position as Lecturer in Archaeology, beginning in September 2017.  The position involves teaching three fundamental courses in anthropological archaeology to undergraduate students most of whom have had modest or no preparation in cultural anthropology or archaeology.  Two of the courses are core subjects required by the BS curriculum for undergraduates majoring in Archaeology and Materials.  These are Introduction to Archaeology, and Human Evolution: Data from Palaeontology, Archaeology, and Materials Science.  The third course is a geographic area elective subject of the lecturer's choice, focusing on, e.g., N. America, China, SW Asia, to complement our strength in Mesoamerica and Andean South America.  We encourage candidates to apply who are engaged in an active research program.  Applicants whose research involves the materials analysis of archaeological or ethnographic artifacts will have ready access to the archaeological materials laboratories of the Center for Materials Research in Archaeology and Ethnology (CMRAE).
</p>
<p>MIT is an institution of higher education focused primarily on the fields of science and engineering and increasingly on disciplines that develop between them.  The Program in Archaeology and Materials is located within the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.  Our undergraduate teaching insists on bringing the perspectives and the science of anthropology and archaeology to students, many of whom eventually will be engaged in engineering efforts to address issues of global consequence.  An essential requirement of applicants for the position of lecturer in our program is the desire and ability to demonstrate to students the value and necessity of adding the human sciences to their engineering tool kit.
</p>
<ul><li>Applications for this position will be reviewed until <b>15 July 2017</b>.  Please apply to: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://careers.mit.edu/">http://careers.mit.edu</a> and choose job number 14691.  Specific questions may be addressed directly to Prof. Heather Lechtman [lechtman@mit.edu].</li></ul>

No nead to sugarcoat things Tulane, but considering how much time many of us spent preparing this application, you could at least have sent out something more thoughtful.

<p>The Department of Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh invites applications for a faculty position at the level of non-tenure stream Lecturer in Anthropology. Pending budgetary approval, the position will begin in fall 2017 with an initial two-year contract, with the possibility of obtaining renewable three-year contracts after satisfactory performance reviews. A PhD in hand at the time of application is required.
</p>
<p>The successful applicant will be expected to advise undergraduate students and assume the duties of Director of the Undergraduate Studies program for the Department of Anthropology. The teaching load will be a 3 + 2 course load during the academic year. The ability to teach large enrollment introductory courses and upper-level elective courses is desirable. We invite applications from candidates with teaching and research experience in North America with a particular emphasis on Native American, African American, or Latino studies from one or more sub-field perspectives (Archaeology, Social and Cultural Anthropology and Physical Anthropology). A particular preference for expertise in the teaching and study of material culture and/or (paleo)demography is sought.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Please submit letter of application, CV, and names/email addresses of three references online at: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://facultysearch.as.pitt.edu/apply/index/MTY3">https://facultysearch.as.pitt.edu/apply/index/MTY3</a>.

<li>WHAT??? This program must have real, serious issues if they are hiring a non-tt lecturer to be the director of undergrad studies.</li>
<li>Not really. This position emphasizes teaching and administration over research, and at this school this emphasis falls into the non-tt category, which can also be very stable and properly compensated.</li>

<p>The Department of Anthropology in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Washington invites applications for a one-year lecturer position in archaeology, beginning September 16, 2017. We seek an archaeologist with a record of successful teaching at the undergraduate level in both large and small classes. Applicants must have earned a doctorate by the date of appointment; applicants who have not completed their Ph.D. at the time of application will be considered. The successful candidate will have an engaging, responsive, and creative pedagogy that relates the history and practice of archaeology to excite and educate students about the field. They will show a commitment to teaching designed to encourage critical thought, student engagement, and sensitivity to archaeology’s political and ethical implications and its responsibilities to a descendant or local communities. Such a record could involve the use of active learning techniques, critical pedagogy, among others, and would demonstrate an awareness of the unique needs of UW’s diverse body of students. Delivering accessible and inclusive undergraduate education and service is integral to our mission as a department. Teaching responsibilities will include six undergraduate courses in archaeology, across three-quarters of a nine-month academic year. Salary is competitive.
</p>
<p>All University of Washington lecturers engage in teaching and service.

<li>Has anyone heard about the job offered at Yale University (see <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://careers.saa.org/jobs/8250698/faculty-research-scientist-department-of-anthropology?utm_source=815797&amp;utm_medium=featuredJobs&amp;utm_campaign=mainLanding&amp;utm_term=">careers.saa.org/jobs/8250698/faculty-research-scientist-department-of-anthropology?utm_source=815797&amp;utm_medium=featuredJobs&amp;utm_campaign=mainLanding&amp;utm_term=</a>)? Is it meant to be an internal hire for the current lab manager? I've not seen the job posted anywhere except on the SAA website; it's not even posted on the university's human resources website.</li>
<li>I am a former student with contacts at the institute and it is an open search. </li>
<li>Any news on this position?</li>
<li>Letters of rec and additional materials requested 9/19</li>
<li>Offer made and accepted 11/15</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul><li>A few great places, but generally looks as dismal as 2013-2014.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I was thinking the same thing, hoping the field would fill in a little after the semester begins and positions are finalized...</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p><br></p>
<hr>
<p>What's up with the Univ of Alabama job? This looks very similar to last year's job posting, which had resulted in a hire (at least, the previous wiki said "offer accepted"). So, is that person already leaving, or did they change their minds and just had to fill in with temps this year, or did they get a 2nd position?
</p>
<ul>
<li>- Last year's hire was for an additional Latin Americanist. After that hire was completed, their Andeanist left for another TT position. They are now filling the vacancy that was just created by that departure.</li>
<li>Two archaeologists in a row have left this position in less than five years. As far as I know, at least two other recent hires left this department before tenure (not even for TT jobs). Something is amiss with Alabama anthropology.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>To address this: I would argue that it is neither naive nor unecessary to broadcast information about a job that may interest some people. First, if the information in the above post is incorrect (I only know about the recent archaeology departures) then please correct it. If it is not incorrect, then this could be important information for people on a very difficult job market, who are in weak negotiating positions and who are making a significant choice about where to work. This information may be particularly helpful because those people may be deciding between different offers, or they may want to investigate potential issues or problems when on campus. Second, it is most certainly in the spirit of the wiki (and especially a section titled "Discussion, Rumors, and Speculation") to speculate. That is the reason why we set up this section of the page. That said, if I had written the original post I would have edited it to read "may be amiss" rather than "is amiss;" but this is a wiki and not a journal article and I hope nobody thinks they have to watch their words. I am not applying, so no horse in this race. Good luck to all on the job market. </li>
<li>People take and leave jobs for all kinds of reasons. It does not necessarily mean anything is amiss. Some jobs pay better than others. Some jobs might be in a state or city where you prefer or do not prefer to live. Some jobs may have few resources than others. Some jobs may be heavier on teaching when you want more research. Other jobs may be super heavy on research to the point that you find the teaching model in practice unrewarding. Some jobs might just be a more prestigious program, and if you are trying to move up the ladder (especially as a junior person with an idealized image that such a ladder actually exists), you might want to be at the more prestigious place. I've heard nothing bad about Alabama. But I do know that both these last two hires' moves are understandable--both due to geographical location and institution. I'd move to where they moved. And also, here is a bottom line, usually when there is something amiss, you won't see it by people leaving. After all, there is no "market" in academic jobs, so you can't just choose to leave unless that choice is leaving academia altogether. In the rare chance you get a second job offer (let alone a first!), there are just far too many factors--many obvious--to conclude that it is a problematic program. Some jobs do have a reputation for being a door mat, however, because they have an opportunity to hire the best people out there given the lack of jobs. But these same people have a lot of mobility. And simply if the job is not in a place where one wants to live, that often is enough. So, Alabama might be finding itself in this place. Wichita State is another one that lost folks in the same position so frequently that I think they lost the line (something 4 in about 6 years). I'm sure there are more. The important thing about Alabama, and a sign it might be a good place, is the fact that despite the fact they lost a couple in the past several years, they are still able to offer a job to some lucky but also qualified person.</li>
<li>FWIW, I'll add that from my perspective -- I am the person who just left the position at the University of Alabama -- nothing at all is amiss with this department. In fact, it is a great place to work and develop your research, and the university is a close community of very collegial scholars with a wide-range of interests. If you make it to campus, and want to ask questions, be sure to talk to people in allied disciplines such as history and geology.</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
<hr>
<ul><li>It would be great if people who have current experience working in states that are in the midst of higher ed budget crises (e.g., Wisconsin, Illinois) could speak to their experiences working there, for those of us considering applying or accepting jobs in those states. What have your experiences been like and what would you tell someone looking to take a job there?</li></ul>
<dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>Illinois here. The coy answer is "it depends" but, generally, it is not recommended that you take a public employee position here (if you have choices). You will be at the mercy of many things. The pension system looks like a disaster and as a public employee, you will have to pay into it rather than Social Security. If you are under 40, you will probably never see full benefits. The state finally passed a stopgap budget to keep entire community colleges and universities from shutting down, but that expires in December. Even those not on the verge of collapse are strained. My school has not hired a new tenure-track faculty member (only some retirement replacements) in many years, there are no more visiting positions, we had our library subscriptions to anthropology and archaeology journals cut entirely, experienced salary freezes, professional development money will be re-negotiated, etc. I understand that lots of anthropologists at public colleges and universities are trying to apply out of state.</li>
<li>Missouri: One of the state schools, UM St Louis, is trying to unionize and the system is pulling out all the big guns to try to squash it. We've already lost health insurance with retirement; the pension is probably the next thing to go. Our pay is not competitive with the region and many of our support staff have been fired. We've been in a hiring and raise freeze for three years though, so not potential archaeologists to warn away.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Thanks for these stories. Super helpful.</li></ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<hr>
<p>Curious to find out whether anyone knows what the story is with the recent VAP posting at Alma College (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://careercenter.aaanet.org/jobs/9046381/visiting-instructor-assistant-professor-of-anthropology">http://careercenter.aaanet.org/jobs/9046381/visiting-instructor-assistant-professor-of-anthropology</a>). Didn't they have a search for an almost the identical job as a tenure track position earlier in the season? What happened with that search?
</p>
<ul><li>I was curious about this too. I had a phone interview with them a few months back but then did not hear back until today. I received an email today saying the search was completed. Perhaps they hired one of the current Visiting Instructor/Professors (they have two listed on faculty currently) into the TT position and now need to replace one?</li></ul>
