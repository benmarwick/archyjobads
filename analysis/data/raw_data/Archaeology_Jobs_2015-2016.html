<p>As part of the our Chancellor’s Faculty Excellence Program, NC State University seeks candidates for four faculty positions to provide key leadership in research and teaching around visual narrative. We seek innovative and transformative academic leaders whose scholarship will advance NC State’s position as one of the premier universities of its kind. These hires will build on a nationally leading, campus-wide strength in visual narrative, games and interactive storytelling, image analytics and digital humanities.
</p>
<p>The Visual Narrative cluster aims to push the shared frontiers of engineering and humanistic research to set a new agenda for advanced multimodal scholarship, opening research pathways in immersive experience, data visualization, image analytics, and computational media. Collectively, the cluster merges its research into new critical narratives about visuality and its digital transformations. It aims to broadly impact our notions of media through its interdisciplinary work and to prepare innovative applications of visual narrative for the emerging challenges of research and human communication in our mediated world. Four new faculty will be recruited to meet this aim – one of those positions is in the Department of History.
</p>
<p>As part of the Chancellor’s Faculty Excellence Program, NC State University seeks expressions of interest and nominations for an open rank, tenure-track faculty member in digital history to join the Visual Narrative cluster. We seek innovative and transformative academic leaders whose scholarship will advance NC State’s position as one of the premier universities of its kind. Ideal candidates will be visionary, innovative researchers whose interests include creative use of visual sources in digital history, including visual culture, spatial history or visualization. The successful senior candidate will be recognized as a pioneering leader in the development of new approaches in these areas with innovative applications. The successful junior candidate will demonstrate strong potential for such leadership. Successful candidates should show a willingness to engage in collaborative efforts with engineers, computer scientists and artists as well as other humanists. Strong collaborations with other faculty within the cluster and NCSU’s existing efforts are expected.
</p>
<p>Minimum requirements include a Ph.D. in history, digital history, art history, public history or other related field from an accredited institution.
</p>
<p>The candidates should have a strong capacity to teach at both undergraduate and graduate levels, including the capacity to mentor doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows.
</p>
<p>Priority will be given to candidates who have demonstrated interdisciplinary collaborations that can cut across academic units.
</p>
<p>Inclusiveness and diversity are academic imperatives, and thus university goals. The university is particularly interested in candidates with experience in working with students from diverse backgrounds and who have a demonstrated commitment to improving access to higher education for students from underrepresented groups.
</p>
<p>You will be required to attach a curriculum vitae, cover letter, and a one-page statement describing your approaches to interdisciplinary work and to collaboration across disciplinary boundaries (Other Document 1). In addition, please arrange to have three letters of reference submitted directly to the Search Committee Chair at visualnarrative@ncsu.edu.
</p>
<p>A comprehensive review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled. The target start date is August 2016, however, a mutually beneficial time may be negotiated. Questions about the positions may be directed to the cluster directors at visualnarrative@ncsu.edu.

This will include a letter of interest, curriculum vita, a teaching statement detailing teaching philosophy and brief description of courses they are prepared to teach, a research statement, and a list of five references.
<ul><li>Wow. Sounds excessive for a first round, no? Why not just CVs, letters, and a list of three refs for stage 1. Then they can cut based on CVs and then intro letters.

<li>Screening will begin <b>November 15th</b> and continue until a suitable candidate is hired.</li>
<li>that is a steep demand for application materials!! I guess this is the new normal?</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>Seems for some. I mind this less (as we all likely have prepared a research statement and evidence of teaching) than when they require LOR up front (and therefore having my committee slog through another round of recs without even knowing if you are in the Top 15 or One of 100). Some much paper, though, especially as the First Round gets just a couple minutes apiece. Why waste additional time, when we all coupld be using our extra energy publishing?</li>
<li>agreed on the steep demand for materials up front...I guess they think their new NAS hire makes their department extra special...I would not waste any time applying unless you are really strong on the neo-Darwinian paradigm.</li>
<li>Horrible online application system!</li>

<p>The University of Pennsylvania Department of Anthropology and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology seek to hire a leading archaeologist at the Associate or Full Professor level to fill the Sally and Alvin V. Shoemaker Endowed Professorship in Anthropology. We are looking for candidates with outstanding research and publication records who can bring innovative ideas, techniques, and new kinds of data to broad questions of current anthropological significance.
</p>
<p>This will be a dual appointment in the Department and the Museum. For the Department, the successful candidate will teach two classes per year ranging from scientific research methodology to the department’s core archaeological curriculum, including undergraduate courses and seminars on theory and her/his regional/temporal specialty. Within the Museum, he or she will hold a curatorial position, and be expected to provide leadership in discussions of collections-based research. The ideal candidate would also be able to contribute to the Museum’s new laboratory-based Center for the Analysis of Archaeological Materials (CAAM) in both teaching and research.
</p>
<p>Temporal focus and geographical area are open, although some preference will be given to candidates with research interests in Africa, Oceania, South Asia or the Maya World. An on-going field and/or laboratory project is essential and researchers who have made major contributions to archaeological science should emphasize this in their applications. The ability to collaborate with archaeological programs in other departments is also desirable.

</p>
<ul><li>Review of applications will begin <b>November 1, 2015</b>, and continue until the position is filled.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Surprise! They want the teaching philosophy as a separate document, not integrated into the cover letter, as their description implies.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Why the deletion of the query about a potential inside candidate? Are we pretending such things don't happen? Or that it's inappropriate to want information about the possibility? Edited to add: It wasn't my query, but its removal puzzles me.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>I didn't delete it, but I can't figure out how to undo its deletion. But, in reading it, it basically said "Looks like there's an inside candidate. Any knowledge?" Pretty general. That said, I think it is a negative comment. It doesn't do anything than open the door for anxiety-fueled venting. What purpose does it really serve, other than giving folks some kind of emotional crutch for a possible eventual rejection? There are probably so many jobs with inside candidates or particular targets. But non-inside folks always have a chance. That said, it is interesting to learn about these kinds of politics.   </li>
<li>I also didn't delete it, and I don't fit the criteria for this position (and am, thus, not applying), but I saw the notes above in recent edits and wanted to contribute to this conversation: I've commented in previous years when I thought or knew of an inside candidate. Yes, there could always be an inside candidate and yes, saying that there is - or may be - may increase anxiety. But 1) I would certainly prefer to know if someone else knows or suspects that and 2) I would still apply if that were the case but would be more careful about time spent trying to land a specific job (including agreeing to long and stressful campus interviews if I suspect I'm not actually in the running for the position).</li>
<li>Agreed. I think it's valuable information and I don't see any harm in sharing what we know. The job search is awful. For everyone. Inside candidates and outside one.  I certainly lean towards having more information rather than less. That said, I have exactly no information about this particular search.</li>
<li>I guess I agree that it is good to know, but I definitely disagree that that kind of info really is productive. If you feel you are qualified, invest. If you get a campus interview but don't go because you suspect that there's an inside candidate that is not a good idea at all. In fact, I'd really, really, really try to talk you out of it if I knew you. If there is an inside candidate, there is nothing you can do about it other than try your hardest. Plus, I've seen inside candidates not get jobs. I admit I like knowing that kind of stuff. I like gossip. But it doesn't do anything.I don't think it really increases anxiety as much as it offers a pre-fashioned way to buffer one against rejection. Plus, it distracts from focusing on what you need to do to get a job: focus on yourself not on possible fears and anxieties surrounding some mysterious other person; there are already enough of them</li>
<li>In the case of this particular job, I'd say it's productive to know if a search has a predetermined outcome (as some do... though certainly not all jobs with "inside candidates"). That information is pertinent for many people -- and is not "gossip" -- because this institution is requesting letters up front. Three letters is a significant amount of lost human capital if a search isn't a bona fide one and I don't take requesting these letters lightly. If a position is already presumed to be going to a particular person, that would help me decide whether to bother my letter writers or not.</li>
<li>I don't take information about inside candidates as disincentive to apply. Just as useful context when writing my cover letter. Sometimes knowing about the inside candidate can tell you a lot about what they're looking for, and the inside doesn't always get the job.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I have to say I disagree and I agree with this exchange. I'll explain both sides of this. On the one hand, of course it's gossip. And as gossip it has that negativeness that the academic job hunt has. And negative energy is poison, especially with this. Not trying to fully apply for a job because of early letters of rec and a possible inside candidate is foolish. It's a pain in the butt, and schools requesting letters so early should be publicly shamed. But assuming that means there is an inside candidate is not necessarily the case. It could be, but who knows. Even if it is, not trying is a bad idea. Here's another reason why, inside candidates often do not get the job. I'm a case in point. I am in my second tenure track position (I come here to just read about the job market and what folks are saying, but I am not on the market now [maybe if a job comes up that does make sense for me, I'll pursue it, but that is unlikely]). Nevertheless, both jobs I received, there was an inside candidate. Both. I had no idea when I applied or when I interviewed, and I am glad for that. It would have been extra stress and may have had contributed to a self-defeating attitude. But there was an inside candidate for both jobs. For one, there was a visiting professor and for the other there was a former post-doc. I don't know how I got the jobs, but I like to think it is because I did a good job at the interview and the job talk. But who knows? Maybe the inside people were so confident that they needlessly shot themselves in the feet? Maybe the inside candidates were not everyone's inside candidate and politics led to me getting hired? Maybe it was luck? Maybe I am still not the person either university really wanted/wants and I should go somewhere else or do something esle? Either way, both times there were inside candidates. Both times knowledge of that did not help me and could have hurt me. Both times I got the job. Ok. That's my take on why I think its gossip, negative, and unhelpful. Now, here's my other take. This, unlike the other side, is based less on experience, but sort of now that I've seen what can happen in academic departments. Having an inside candidate is shitty. It's crappy. It should be viewed as unethical. There is no way, absolutely no way, none whatsoever, that any inside candidate is beyond compare in job qualifications. Not in this job "market." There are people with big grants, many articles, awards, books, tons of teaching experience, etc., looking for jobs. There is no way that any inside candidate can be guaranteed to be the best. Just no way. So, if a department has a committment to an inside candidate before a search, it tells you a lot about the department. That it's political. That it's whatever. It also can tell you what you might expect if you get an interview or, like me, the actual job. Things might be turbulent or rocky or not every faculty member welcoming. I don't know. But it is gossip. It is negative. But it can be useful information. But it should absolutely in no way prevent you from applying for the job and trying to get the job. </li></ul></dd></dl>

<li>Anyone know what the story is here? This appears to be exactly the same search as last year --- the one that got over 400 applicants, took forever, and was accepted by someone at the end of March. Did the funding fall through?</li>
<li>I wonder if there is already a candidate in mind since they went through the same search last year.</li>
<li>They made offers to two candidates last year, but both turned them down and stayed at their home institutions</li>
<li>This is not true at all. I am not sure if they made two offers or not. But they definitely made one offer, and the individual most definitely accepted. The individual was on a post-doc, and negotiated a start at the end of the post-doc. This job does indeed sound similar to last year's, but with one key exception: "applicants specializing in the Old World are preferred." The candidate who accepted the job last year was a New World archaeologist.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>You are right... I stand corrected. It only appears to be the same search. As you suggest, last year's was geographically open while this one is Old World preferred. And I am very glad to learn that we received a false report (though not so glad to be reminded just how reliable wiki information really is). It does help to restore just a little faith in the process.</li>

<li>No news at all about anything - glad I checked...was wondering what was going on - this is their second or third attempt at filling this position. Good luck to those with interviews. (10/23)</li>

<li>This is an interesting search. Two archaeologists are retiring. They started as Mayanists, and continue to be Mayanists, but also started working in Ohio since they were the only archaeologists there and could do field schools. They just hired an archaeobotanist who works in the same area. I wonder if they are trying to eliminate the Meso-aspect and build up the N. American, or if they hire last year already moved on to another program. ANy info?</li>

<li>Yes, I started the application and immediately got a confirmation email. Once I had submitted all the documents, I got an email from the search committee chair (~24 hours later) confirming that my application had been received. (10/14)</li>

<li>What happened to this job last year? If anybody connected to the search reads this wiki, please read this: DO NOT SEND OUT REQUESTS FOR LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION SO FREAKING EARLY! This was not done due to some crappy automated system like a lot of jobs; the search committee requested them (or requested that applicants request them). It seemed really symptomatic of a problematic search, and I was not surprised it was cancelled. But, whatever, it really wastes the time of everyone.</li>
<li>I was interviewed not long after letter requests went out. Campus visits occurred, offers were made. Search was cancelled for the next year.</li>
<li>So why was the search cancelled? </li>
<li>The search was cancelled because the person they offered the job accepted another offer somewhere else.</li>
<li>They didn't ask everyone for letters, just the people they were genuinely interested in. (I was asked for letters, but didn't get an interview.) It seemed like a perfectly normal search to me, but maybe I missed something. It just didn't work out with any of the four candidates they interviewed, and the search committee wasn't very happy about it, either.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>My apologies. I totally got this one confused with another job where the search was cancelled. But, on another note, was this the case where the candidates did not accept the job? That seems to have happened a lot last year for many jobs either because the candidate took another job or, what seems more likely, people had jobs and stayed put after the offer was made. That must be very frustrating for those in need of jobs, when nobody gets hired at all since the candidate wasn't attracted from the job she/he already has. I believe the NYU job didn't hire some people last year due to this, and the U of A job was a complete debacle: U of A. SW job. And they hired nobody since all the candidates turned them down. U of A. SW job. That is some surreal crazy sh%t. U of A couldn't hire a SW person. Crazy, crazy, crazy. That place must be problematic, but maybe SW archaeology is in decline. At least NYU is hiring again. I think another job search was cancelled last year since the retiring person changed his mind. Nice. Anyway, the market doesn't look too good this year. Hell, even the wiki doesn't seem that active. But, it's still August, I suppose. Maybe things will improve. I plan on getting 5 campus interviews and 7 job offers this year, but I won't accept anything that does not come with an endowed chair and full tenure, and a ferrari (and I don't even have a driver's license).</li>
<li>(10/5) Has anyone else logged into Interfolio lately?  The dossier now posts as "incomplete." They added two additional categories since I submitted on 9/4, including "Research Statement" and "Three Letters of Recommendation."  I have received no message, and have no reason to believe this is a personalized request for additional materials.  Any thoughts?</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>I see the same thing on my Interfolio account. However, it says submitted so hopefully it's fine (X3, 10/5).</li>
<li>Just an observation, but if they're pulling this nonsense again and requesting letters so early in the process (my interfolio has the same as above) I'm just going to let this one go past. Not going to put my references through doing that again when it's clear they're just asking for this from *all* applicants.</li>
<li>A friend received an e-mail from Interfolio requesting letters of recommendation and a research statement. I'm guessing (note that this is only a guess - I have no insider insights into this search) that everyone who applied for this job, regardless of whether they are now being considered further, will now see the option to upload these materials in their Interfolio account and that their application is "incomplete", even if the search committee only wants materials from people who received e-mails to that effect.</li>

<li>Review of applications will begin <b>November 16, 2015</b>, and will continue until the position is filled.</li>
<li>I realize that this is a wiki, which means that there is little if any central oversight, but someone made a big mistake with this job posting. Note, above the title states that the "Deadline" is November 16. The job ad states that review of applications <i>will begin</i> on November 16, which means that the deadline was, effectively, November 15. I am not sure if this error has hurt anyone's chances for this job--I am not applying, so no stakes in this conversation besides a "heads up."</li>
<li>Okay, now that I posted that, I noted that the deadline langauge for many of these job ads is a bit strange. Many of them state in the job ad title that the <i>deadline</i> is on a specific date, but then the ad states that the department will <i>begin to review</i> applications on that date. Why not just post the date for the application review? I know for certain that some search committees start the application review on the date listed, so if they list that they will review applications on November 16, for example, it means that the applications should be submitted beforehand, by November 15... right? In these cases, shouldn't the wiki list the day before as the deadline and not the day that the review will begin? </li>
<li>I've been on the market for several years and only this year did I notice this sort of language as well. As a result, I've started trying to submit at least a day before the deadline. But I wonder how many deadlines I've actually "missed" previously.</li>
<li>I realized my application was a day late for this reason too, unfortunately. Thanks to whoever recently updated the wiki to Nov 15, but alas, it was long after I had copied the information into my personal files.</li>
<li>E-mail confirmation of materials received and review underway (11/16)</li>

</p>
<p>In this position you will undertake teaching, research and administrative duties in Archaeology in line with the School's learning and teaching, and research strategies.
</p>
<p>The position will require you to undertake undergraduate and postgraduate teaching (campus-based and distance-learning) in Archaeology in the School of Archaeology &amp; Ancient History and contribute towards research and administration as detailed below. You will be required to take up the post on 1 October 2015 or as soon as possible thereafter.
</p>
<p>This post will develop the School’s strong track record in more recent periods of archaeology. Specialisms of particular interest are heritage and historical archaeology (in a broad sense). Period/area specialisms within these fields could include Mesoamerica, Western Asia and archaeologies of the Islamic world, although others which complement existing staff interests and activities will be considered. Additional desirable skills include standing buildings (including digital methodologies in this area), fieldwork and other practical archaeological skills or some relevant aspect of environmental archaeology or archaeological science.

<ul>
<li>I know several people in the department; those sources are unanimous in telling me that it's taking longer than normal (by UK standards) to finalise a shortlist as they were advertising for several positions simultaneously, including several fixed-term positions alongside this permanent one. They now have to shortlist for all of them. In addition, they've only just appointed a brand-new Acting Head of School.  So logistical and bureaucratic issues have led to a delay.</li>
<li>I know that the lectureship in ancient history has been filled. So I guess this lectureship also by now (11 Sept)?</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>As of today (14 Sept) it has not been filled to the best of my knowledge.</li></ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
<ul><li>Does this mean that the shortlisting process is still ongoing?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>To the best of my knowledge (16 Sept), yes - though this could change imminently.  British hiring processes differ from many North American processes.  They typically go straight to the final campus presentation &amp; interview stage without any intermediate stage of Skype interviews or similar.  So they're trying to whittle this down to the final 5 or so candidates, but have had very strong interest in the position, and are also simultaneously hiring for fixed-term teaching fellowships.  The scale of the task has led to a delay.</li>
<li>This is a sort of some good news. I know people who applied for the job and they had lost hopes!</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
<ul><li>Campus interviews scheduled to take place the 24th of September for the five shortlisted candidates.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Given that most readers of this wiki are North Americans, it's also perhaps worth adding quickly that all of the shortlisted candidates are currently based at UK institutions.</li></ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><ul>
<li>Rejection received (following campus interview) - best of luck to whoever was successful, both department and other candidates were very friendly.</li>
<li>Paradoxically, given the advert phrasing, they hired a prehistorian and specialist in the pre-Columbian Caribbean; this was the only candidate whose research <i>wasn't</i> focused on the archaeology of a historical period (in a broad sense).</li>

<p>The Department of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse is seeking a dynamic archaeologist who is looking to teach motivated students in a collegial, supportive, and collaborative atmosphere. We have one of the largest Archaeology programs in the country with approximately 100 undergraduate majors and 8 archaeology and anthropology faculty members. Our open position is for a tenure track, Assistant Professor of Archaeology to begin late August 2016. We seek applications from individuals who hold a Ph.D. in anthropology or archaeology by time of appointment.
</p>
<p>Preference will be given to candidates with methodological expertise (e.g., bioarchaeology, zooarchaeology, lithic analysis, etc.) that complements existing faculty specialties. Candidates with research experience in North America (excluding Mexico) are especially encouraged to apply, but all applications will be considered from candidates whose geographic focus complements, rather than duplicates, current faculty regional interests. Candidates who have experience with a variety of teaching methods, have the potential to obtain research funding, and have the ability and strong desire to incorporate undergraduate students in their research activities are preferred.
</p>
<p>The successful candidate will be foremost an inspirational teacher, role model, and mentor to students with varying career goals. The successful candidate must express their dedication to a four field approach to high quality undergraduate education in anthropology. Responsibilities include: 1) teaching World Archaeology, Historical and Theoretical Perspectives in Archaeology, Senior Thesis, and upper level courses in the applicant's area of expertise that meet curricular demand; 2) providing students with fieldwork/research opportunities; 3) supervising undergraduate research; and 4) advising archaeology majors and anthropology minors. The Department of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology values diversity and supports the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse in its effort to be a leader in Wisconsin's movement toward increased diversity and inclusiveness.

<li>The position is open until filled, however the review of applications will begin on <b>November 2, 2015</b>.</li>
<li>"Excluding Mexico"? That seems rather arbitrary. Why would a Mayanist who studies in Guatemala or Belize be more welcome than one who works a few kilometers away in Mexico? They have an Andeanist but nobody else working in Latin America. How about "No left-handed people need apply"?</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>I would imagine that it's because undergrads can't participate in excavations in Mexico? Or when they talk about North America, they don't mean to include C. America and thus aren't looking for a Mayanist per se.</li>
<li>Mexico is part of North America (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico</a>) so I took the exclusion to mean they will give preference to scholars who study the prehistory of the US or Canada. The exclusion is a technicality.</li>
<li>I don't believe undergraduates can participate fully in Guatemala, either. North America can be interpreted to mean everything north of Panama, but I imagine they mean the cultures that would fall under a "North American Prehistory" course. Indeed, good luck to the applicants.</li>

<p>We seek an anthropological archaeologist working in any part of the Americas except the Maya region to teach undergraduate and graduate courses, to advise students, to conduct research, to perform other scholarly activities including publishing in scholarly journals, and to participate in departmental governance and university service. Ph.D. in Anthropology or Archaeology is required. Candidates must have demonstrated excellence in original theoretical and methodological research that complements the existing strengths of the department. Active fieldwork or lab research is required. The candidate is expected to work with graduate students in developing research projects and must have a demonstrable commitment to innovative undergraduate and graduate instruction, ideally including experience teaching introduction to archaeology.
</p>
<p>Candidates with research focused on the following regions and topics are especially encouraged: South America; the Intermediate Area; human interaction with climate and environment; foodways and diet; societal diversity and identity; multiregional interactions and political economy.
</p>
<p>Applications should consist of a Curriculum Vitae, a cover letter describing ongoing research and teaching interests, and the names of three referees. Applicants must have a Ph.D. in hand by time of appointment. All materials should be sent as MSWord files or PDFs via e-mail with “Archaeology Search” in the subject line to: Lauren Valle &lt;lavalle@wustl.edu&gt;.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Priority will be given to applications received on or before Friday, <b>October 23, 2015</b>, but the search will continue until the position is filled.</li>
<li>"(excl. Maya)" ha ha ha. Funny how an entire generation of professors have zero intention of retiring.</li>
<li>We all know that after the recession, a ton of end-of-career professors hung on for a few extra years to rebuild their retirement savings, and we continue to wait for these positions (if they are replaced at all). In this case, however, Mayanists are not excluded because of the retirement schedule of current faculty. It is more complicated. This is a great department. Good luck to all applicants. Mayanists may find succor in the relatively high number of Latin American positions available this year.</li>

<p>The AAA has requested that search committees refrain from asking for letters of recommendation until initial screening of applicants has been completed:

<p>Could someone with the necessary skills to successfully manipulate complex Wiki entries please create a quick reference spreadsheet for all jobs on this wiki--perhaps appearing just below and similar in format to the "Current Users" section? And perhaps with these simple column headers?

<p>INSTITUTION     JOB_TITLE    DEADLINE     PREFERRED_FOCI     STATUS   (and any other headings deemed appropriate...)

<p>This would be a much more convenient way for everyone to quickly check in on employment opportunities (and presumably more useful than stats on current users of the wiki)...would happily do it myself but I have no idea how to make it work...
</p>
<ul><li>Thanks for this suggestion. In my long experience with this wiki as an admin, I can say this kind of jobs table has been tried on various pages over the years, but it has proven difficult for users to edit and maintain. Fields that manage to set this up usually abandon it. A table to keep track of Users (like above) is easier to keep up, but when the full season is in swing and lots of jobs and updates are coming in, a table that involves more complex code and editing skills tends to fall apart, generate lots of complaints and waste a lot of time. If somebody can come along with a fabulous hack to make tables work better on this wiki, great; I have yet to see it happen and it's beyond my skill set .... In the meantime, the best way to follow updates to this page (new positions added, interview info. etc.) is by subscribing to the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.whatisrss.com/">RSS feed</a> for this page: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="text" href="https://academicjobs.fandom.com/wiki/Archaeology_Jobs_2015-2016?feed=rss&amp;action=history">http://academicjobs.wikia.com/wiki/Archaeology_Jobs_2015-2016?feed=rss&amp;action=history</a> A rudimentary RSS reader is embedded at the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="text" href="https://academicjobs.fandom.com/wiki/Archaeology_Jobs_2015-2016#RECENT_ACTIVITY_on_Archaeology_Jobs_Wiki">top of the page</a>; more sophisticated RSS readers are recommended here: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://www.slant.co/topics/446/~what-are-the-best-news-readers">http://www.slant.co/topics/446/~what-are-the-best-news-readers</a> - Hope this helps! --<a href="/wiki/User:Una74" title="User:Una74">Una74</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Una74" title="User talk:Una74">talk</a>) 17:15, July 26, 2015 (UTC)</li></ul>
