<p>Baylor University Department of Anthropology is seeking an archaeologist for a tenure-track position at the rank of assistant or associate professor. We are interested in an archaeologist whose research focuses on subsistence adaptations or responses to environmental and/or climate change. Scholars whose work incorporates archaeological science (e.g., ecological modeling, statistical analysis, and/or bio-archaeology) are particularly encouraged to apply. Geographic specialization is open but should complement those of existing faculty.
</p>
<p>The appointment will begin August 1, 2015 and the candidate must have Ph.D. prior to this date. An active research program, peer-reviewed publications, and funded research are required. A clear potential for funding of a strategically planned research agenda is necessary.
</p>
<p>Responsibilities include teaching undergraduate survey courses and lower and upper division archaeology courses in the existing curriculum, research, publishing of research in peer-reviewed venues, seeking and managing external funding, and participating in planning and administrative work within the department and university. The position will involve working with interdisciplinary graduate students.
</p>
<p>Baylor University is a private Christian university and a nationally ranked research institution, consistently listed with highest honors among The Chronicle of Higher Education’s “Great Colleges to Work For.” Chartered in 1845 by the Republic of Texas through the efforts of Baptist pioneers, Baylor is the oldest continually operating university in Texas. The university provides a vibrant campus community for over 15,000 students from all 50 states and more than 80 countries by blending interdisciplinary research with an international reputation for educational excellence and a faculty commitment to teaching and scholarship. Baylor is actively recruiting new faculty with a strong commitment to the classroom and an equally strong commitment to discovering new knowledge as we pursue our bold vision, Pro Futuris.

<li>Anyone know how strict the "official" transcript requirement is here? That seems like an unnecessary expense for 1st round applicants.</li>
<li>They were pretty explicit about requiring official transcripts when they confirmed the receipt of my applications and implied that unless they received them that my application would be considered incomplete and therefore not considered.  But they do accept electronic versions of official transcripts from insitutions that have the mechanisms in place to track and deliver these documents.</li>
<li>I think it goes without saying that asking for official transcipts from job applicants is pretty ridiculous, on all levels.
<ul><li>As does discounting people who aren't religious, which happened to me when I applied for their last job.  If you make the cut, the Board of Trustees has the committees send out a questionaire to weed out athiests and agnostics from Christians and Jews (not sure what they think about other religions).</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fairly sure there's an inside candidate for this position anyway.</li>
<li>Email informing me I was on the "initial short list" and the very uncomfortable religious affiliation request. (11/19) x 2
<ul>
<li>I received the HR information request, but nothing about 'initial short list'. Was that request sent to everyone?</li>
<li>I got that form during the last go-round and discussed all of my involvements with churches and ritual specialists at my field site but made it clear that I was an atheist.  Never heard back from them.</li>
<li>Why would an atheist apply for a job at a "Christian University"? Would you really want to work there? I wouldn't even apply...</li>
<li>Because rent needs to be paid. You might prefer to leave academia than have to teach at a Christian University, but for other atheists, teaching at a Christian University might be the lesser of evils.</li>
<li>But why apply if you are not Christian - you know they won't hire you. Why sell your soul? Would you do anything (including pretending to be a religion you are not) just to get a job?.....I think academics should be more principled, no?</li>
<li>I'm not applying but this is entirely school dependent. Some Christian schools seek a diverse faculty with a range of beliefs (e.g. Notre Dame). Others are more narrowly focused (e.g BYU). So evaluate case by case, I have no idea how seriously Baylor takes this. Be prepared to have frequent religious "conversations" with students in class however.</li>
<li>I didnt apply for this job, mostly because I wouldnt want to deal with what I imagine would be a constant battle with some religious students. But, to be fair, the Anthropology department has a statement saying they support the AAA statement on evolution, suggesting, at least in the department, that science rules over religious beliefs. It is hard to know whether certain 'religious' institutions tend to fall on the more secular side (e.g. Notre Dame, as noted previously) or the more dogmatic. I dont think there is anything wrong with applying for these jobs as an atheist, as these positions should be hired on scholarly merit, first and foremost. Unfortunately, this clearly isnt the case.</li>
<li>On a side note, the Geology Department at Baylor has a number of excellent evolutionary paleobiologists on the faculty.</li>
<li>Of course, not all Christians are creationists in the American sense. Take a look at Europe.</li>
<li>Baylor is a Baptist university... </li>
<li>Either way - take a look at European Christians, and the lack of the polarised debate that occurs in the USA.</li>
<li>Sure... I am aware of the differences. But this discussion is about a position at Baylor University, which is Baptist. That said, I see no reason or relevance for questioning why people might apply for this job, whether those people are atheists, Muslims, or Baptists. A job is a job, and... in Europe, the USA, and elsewhere... one rarely has the option or opportunity to work for an institution that perfectly fits one's "principles." (+1)</li>
<li>I have to disagree: Baylor clearly states that it is a private Christian university (in Texas of all places) - this is a clear sign post that for me (a non-American, non-Christian) says keep clear! A job is a job? To think that working and teaching in a university is just a job is quite strange. But, maybe for some it is just a job.....By the way, I should say that I've worked and lived in 5 countries in North America and Europe, so my perspective is really comparing Europe with the US, where the religious divide in the latter is stark. For me personally, there are so many parts of the US that are no-go areas for political, cultural, and religious reasons, as well as quality of life. Looking at the list of job postings on this site, I'd find it hard to live and work in the vast majority of those places! So, maybe a career change is in order for me?
<ul>
<li>Honestly? Yes, either a career change or massive wake up call may be in order. I am an American who got a PhD in Europe and also held a postdoc there. The competition for permanent jobs there has nothing on the American system. We regularly had less than 100 applicants (somtimes closer to 20-30) for permanent jobs at the European institutions. Compare this to hundreds at the average U.S. job. This means that unless you are a highly sought after superstar, most people cannot afford to be picky about things like local culture or politics. It is simply too much of a buyers market. In Europe you have the support of a big, well-funded postdoc system, where many new PhDs end up funnelling into. In the U.S. most new PhDs and ABDs are applying straight into the TT market, meaning there is fiece competition.</li>
<li>"picky about things" - it comes down to what's more important: a career for the sake of a career, or deciding what's important for oneself and raising a family. I certainly wouldn't raise my children in Texas (to pick the Baylor example)....No massive wake call needed here; I'm well aware of realities and well aware of what kind of society/local culture I choose to be in and contribute to! I guess some people are very focused/driven, and willing to compromise on much more than me in terms of where they would choose to live; or it doesn't bother them as much. Anyhow, best of luck.</li>
<li>Crime stats for Waco, Texas, home of Baylor <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://www.clrsearch.com/Waco-Demographics/TX/Crime-Rate">http://www.clrsearch.com/Waco-Demographics/TX/Crime-Rate</a> Depressing...</li>
<li>It seems as though some people may also think that they can be a positive force in such communities. On that note, I suggest that you all respect the other people on this wiki -- those who are here to see news about hires and not to read your personal opinions on Texas, Christianity, and the USA -- and move this chat to the Discussion section below. Cheers!</li>
<li>OK! I actually began all my comments here with a defense of the Christian university's right to only hire Christians! So, I was trying to be open minded....but my true colours of a distaste for much of America came through. Apologies to all for my personal opinions: I'll leave it at that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I will clarify my above comment: this and all other university positions are not "<i>just jobs,</i>" and of course, I never said that they were "<i>just jobs</i>.<i>"</i> But they are "<i>jobs</i>," which means that they offer opportunities to teach an anthropological perspective, whether the institution that cuts the paycheck explicitly agrees with that perspective or not. But... good luck to you and everyone else!

<p>Brown University, Department of Anthropology, invites applications for a tenure-track position at the rank of Assistant Professor with a geographical specialization in New World archaeology and a research focus on “complex societies.” The applicant's research interests should complement those of the departmental faculty.

<li>I gotta say, and I know I am just complaining, but a letter and separate statements of research and teaching is ridiculous, on the one hand, and something I am sure not even the search committee wants.

<li>Maybe you should think of them as writing examples. A cover letter is like an introduction. Short, sweet. Then the separate statements of research and teaching expand on this intro. Treat these as an opportunity, not a burden....(+1)</li>
<li>I can understand a teaching statement from teaching-heavy schools, but at Brown this does seem like overkill. Added to which I hear conflicting things about what they are interested in for this job. Interesting that they exteded the deadline by two weeks, too.</li>
<li>Not to mention that Interfolio is such a terrible venue to use for this. Not user friendly at all</li>

<li>Does anyone have information regarding the search GM conducted back in 2011-2012? This sounds like a nice job at a cool place.</li>
<li>The previous search was for a historical archaeologist (African Diaspora?) but it was apparently cancelled/closed and judging from their current faculty list, no-one was hired. Fairfax is a nice city, btw, but the only bummer is that it is very expensive to live there and the traffic is pretty bad (not Boston levels, but still bad). Ordinary run of the mill houses can be half a million bucks or more easily nowadays in the greater Northern Va area. I doubt that an ordinary faculty salary can cope with that well. Of course, given this market, it will slow no-one down from applying (nor should it!) but just an FYI...and like I said, you'd probably like living there anyways.</li>

<dl><dd><ul><li>It looks very similar.  They did hire a new person last year, but they are apparently not serving as director of Arch Services. Very strange. However, this is different in that it is "Archaeological Geophysicist".  I would love to hear the inside story on how they hired someone to not do they job required by the position they were trying to fill. It seems like a good department, but I will not be applying this year.</li></ul></dd></dl>

</li>
<li>Just received an email from the search committee saying that the search had been canceled (12/22). (EDIT--it's the Complex Society job, not this environmental position).</li>
<li>Just received an email that the Complex Society job at NIU (I thought this one had its own entry, but don't see it here anymore) was also canceled. (12/22)</li>
<li>Yeah.  Looking back at the email, it was from ANTHArchCompSoc@niu.edu--I wasn't aware that there were multiple jobs and the other isn't listed here.  So this one might not be canceled after all?  Sorry if I freaked anyone out.</li>
<li>I actually think both searches were canceled. :( I had heard that there were university-wide budget cuts due to the new IL gov and that there is a campus-wide hiring freeze.  Perhaps someone else has more info?</li>
<li>I've heard from someone affiliated with the department that while the Complex Societies job was canceled, the environmental search is still active.</li>
<li>Skype interview scheduled. (1/30)</li>

Specialty interests may include GIS, paleoethnobotany, archaeometry, geoarchaeology, zooarchaeology, or other skills that complement existing departmental strengths. Regional focus is open. Excellent teaching at the graduate and undergraduate levels is necessary, including general anthropology courses as well as upper division courses in areas of expertise. Ability to teach quantitative data analysis is desirable. The successful candidate will join and contribute to the recently established interdisciplinary Area of Excellence: The SDSU Center for Climate and Sustainability Studies (C2S2).

<li>Application review will begin on <b>October 15, 2014</b> and the position will remain open until filled.</li>
<li>I applied and did not receive an acknowledgment of receipt.</li>
<li>My apologies, this was supposed to be handled by an admin. Short acknowledgment emails have gone out (10/10)</li>
<li>Additional materials requested and references requested (in the most considerate email I've ever received from a prospective employer!) 10/29 (x5)</li>
<li>Heard they have a long list established</li>
<li>Received message from Employee Relations and Compliance requesting submission of a Voluntary Confidential Data Form 11/25 (x5)
<ul><li>I received the Voluntary Confidential Data Form but I wasn't asked for additional materials earlier. Probably won't bother sending it in.
<ul>
<li>You can still be a candidate even if they didn't request additional materials. Sometimes you'll hear nothing and suddenly be on a short-list.
<ul><li>Make a short list without letters of recommendation? Unlikely, but I see you're in SD so maybe you have more insight than I do.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Yeah, right.  If they want people to fill out the form, they should probably do it when the person still has some reasonable hope of being hired.  If they are really bent on hiring me, I doubt that not filling out the data form would be a major hit.  I agree with the person above - not going to waste my time and whoever forgot to send the forms out earlier can deal with whatever consequence there might be.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Has anyone heard from SDSU since the additional materials request?</li>
<li>CAMPUS INTERVIEW SCHEDULED</li>
<li>Polite email that the search has been cancelled and the job will be reposted in the fall (4/21)</li>
<li>For those of you who received interviews, but the search was cancelled, so sorry. That job seemed poorly executed from the beginning. Asking for letters so early (i.e., actually asking and not some system-computer generated request), seems to be evidence of a poorly designed search. Even the wording of this recent email suggests that the search committee is poorly experienced (i.e., difficult decisions were made, which was a challenge, but we aren't going to tell you where you stood). Too bad</li>

<p>The Department of Anthropology at Stanford University invites applications for a tenure-track faculty appointment in archaeology. The appointment will be made at the Assistant Professor rank. The successful applicant must hold a PhD in archaeology. While the area is open, we expect that the successful candidate would add to the geographical scope and to the methodological and laboratory breadth of the archaeology program. The Anthropology Department has a unique interdisciplinary focus that emphasizes theoretically informed analyses of social and cultural processes and quantitative research. Therefore, a program of fieldwork, as well as broad theoretical and substantive interests, are essential for this position.
</p>
<ul>
<li>For full consideration, materials must be received by <b>November 3, 2014</b>. The term of appointment would begin September 1, 2015. Send vita, letter describing qualifications and interests, one example of written work and the names of three referees to Professor Lynn Meskell, Chair, Archaeology Search Committee, Department of Anthropology, 450 Serra Mall, Building 50, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-2034.

<li>I didn't get any response. What's the protocol for giving a nudge? (N/M, got an email yesterday)</li>
<li>My guess is that it took sometime to get through all the application emails (as there are likely many) and forward those materials. I only received my HR email yesterday as well. </li>
<li>yes my guess is that they will have hundreds and hundreds of applications for this post!</li>
<li>^^^ Indeed, inside source says over 300 applications. REVIEW IS UNDERWAY (11/12)</li>

<li>I'd say email the email address given above: I'm sure that's fine.</li>
<li>And check your spam box from "facultysearchselfid@stanford.edu" and also check other email addresses if you have them. I received (on Nov 6) the HR link to affirmative action forms at an address different from the one from which I actually sent them my application - they must have pulled that email from my CV, which has two emails listed.</li>

<p>The School of Anthropology will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2015. We have 46 core (voting) faculty and an active group of Southwest archaeology students and faculty with strong ties to American Indian Studies, the Arizona State Museum, the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, the Southwest Center, and many other departments and programs across campus. The University of Arizona's interdisciplinary strengths in environmental studies, archaeometry, conservation science, and remote sensing and spatial analysis are widely drawn upon by faculty and students, especially by our archaeologists.The School of Anthropology (College of Social and Behavioral Sciences) at the University of Arizona seeks an anthropological archaeologist for a tenure-track Assistant Professor position to begin in August 2015.
</p>
<p>We invite applicants with a geographic specialization in the southwestern United States or adjacent areas in northern Mexico. We seek an individual with a scholarly research record, including successful external funding, and an innovative research program that will engage students in the field and laboratory. Ability to work collaboratively and across disciplines, and to teach undergraduate and graduate courses is also expected. We have a preference for someone who focuses on the archaeology of the prehispanic period or Native American contact period. Ability to teach quantitative methods at the graduate level is preferred but not required. Problem orientation and analytical specialties are open. Ph.D. must be in hand at the time of application.
</p>
<p>The School is seeking an individual who is able to work with diverse students and colleagues, and who has experience with a variety of teaching methods and curricular perspectives. As an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer, the University of Arizona recognizes the power of a diverse community and encourages applications from individuals with varied experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds.

</li>
<li>Review begins <b>11-01-2014</b>.</li>
<li>Applicants requested to contact references and have them submit letters by December 10. On campus interviews anticipated for mid-January to early February.</li>
<li>Contacted via email to schedule interview - 12-16-2014.</li>
<li>At least one interviewee has already had a gig for more than 7 years, doesn't have a ton of publications, especially first-authored ones, and has only been on some major grants, but not as a PI. Really, UA? Why not give more newbies a shot.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>Can we keep crap like this off the Wiki please? (X3)</li>
<li>Obviously, they thought that the person was worthy of the position, otherwise the person would not have been interviewed.  They are just trying to do the best they can for their department and that person is trying to do the best that they can for their career.  I agree that it sucks to have a PhD and be sitting here jobless while gainfully employed people are just shuttling around looking for something better, but the whole system is screwed up and the truth is that many of us will never get a tenure-track position (no matter how awesome we are) - we'll get a low-paying teaching gig somewhere, research if we are super lucky, or we'll simply get sick of it playing the game (like pretending not to be "jaded" so that search committees will like us if we ever do get an interview) and move on to something else.  Just like the 66-year old woman who bags my groceries and couldn't get a job in her field way back in the day.  Meanwhile UA will continue to churn out almost a dozen PhDs a year on top of what's already out there.   </li>
<li>According to the numbers above, 89 people using this wiki don't have a tenure-track job. Tons of people are worthy of positions, but very few are seriously considered for them. If someone doesn't start speaking up and making it clear to search committee members that they need to broaden who they consider for these positions (beyond those from select schools, or beyond those they know personally), then we're all screwed. The discipline, with it's glut of new PhDs who are mostly done before they ever have a chance, is undermining itself (killing it's young, if you will) by not hiring the relatively new entries into the job market. But after 7 years (yes, in reference to above)...you've had your chance. And turning assistant professor positions into associate ones is also part of the problem. Yes, the whole system is screwed up. So, let's stop pretending it's not. Can we keep this crap off the wiki? No.</li>
<li>You may recall that 7 years ago there was a global financial meltdown. Many institutions that were hiring that year were obliged to cancel their searches. Many institutions then suffered hiring freezes, some of which lasted for years. The numbers: Between 2007 and 2008 there was a 19% decrease in the number of advertised anthropology academic positions. Between 2008 and 2009 there was a further decrease of 22%. Between 2007 and 2009, 18.4% of institutions reported losing faculty lines in anthropology and the vast majority of those lines were lost in PhD granting institutions (data all deriving from the AAA report). To suggest that "after 7 years...you've had your chance" is to have a remarkably short memory.</li>
<li>No short memory. If you've been in a TENURE TRACK position for 7 years, I'd say you had a very good chance. If you haven't had luck finding a secure t-t position after 7 years, then you haven't even been given that chance. There's a difference. I didn't mean after 7 years of finishing.</li>
<li>It is really horrible the day you realize you are competing for your first job against a bunch of people with T-T positions, I've sometimes felt crushed by this too.  But, it has always been this way, and it's not going to change.  A frightening number of T-T people are trying to move for all kinds of perfectly valid reasons each year, and there will ALWAYS be well-qualified people who are willing to give up their tenure to move to the job you also want.  That goes double for top-ranked departments like UA, places I generally EXPECT to hire someone who was already T-T elsewhere, even for an assistant prof position.  In past years I've seen newish grads with what to my eyes seemed unimpressive CVs get ultra-desirable jobs I know some proven, excellent T-T people were short-listed for and desperately wanted, and that feels just as "unfair" to those of us who somehow expected a meritocracy as seeing a tenured person move into an assistant prof position feels to you right now.  The job market is a screwed-up mess of flukes and the apparent randomness of things like the dreaded "fit", but don't hate the player, hate the game, and hope the bizarre randomness of the whole thing works in your own favor someday.</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Does anyone know the status of this search? I'm in Tucson and I've heard nothing since all the job talks. I guess none of the people directly involved follow the Wiki or are keeping quiet.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>I believe their first choice accepted the ASU job.  I don't know who the 2nd choice was and/or whether they took the job or not.  The other two candidates have jobs already so negotiations might be different/longer? </li>
<li>The person who got the job was indeed already tenured. I believe he had written books, major articles, and is now a PI on a big NSF. That's a good record and it's a record that is hard to beat. The basic truth out there is that almost all individuals ALREADY in tenure track jobs apply for jobs every year. It is the only way to get a better job and often the only way to get resources improved at your existing job. I am on my third TT job, and I applied for two jobs last year for many different reasons. People complain for many reasons about how crazy academic hiring processes are compared the private sector (i.e., why can't we follow through with applications, why can't we call, why can't we do this and that). All that is crazy bullshit, I agree. But, in many respects, so is this resentment. This is a JOB. The sentiment of giving newbies a chance based on some system of fairness is absurd. It is simply not how jobs get filled anywhere. It is the meritocratic naivete of a graduate student mind. I'm not criticizing it; I had that for years and still retain its effect. But people in academia, surprisingly, get jobs for the same reasons people get jobs in the private sector: hard work, brilliance, innovation, nepotism, gender, race/ethnicity, perceived pedigree, legacy, baby-boomer selfishness, etc., etc., etc. Neither one of these is more powerful than another. Looking at the short list for the two AZ jobs, it is pretty clear that anyone not having a PhD from either U of A or ASU was at a disadvantage. This was related to the pedigree of the candidates' PhD, the extremely high quality of their work, and the desire for existing faculty to maintain their legacies. There are clear rivalries and close, friendly competition between the two SW programs, and the existing faculty want, perhaps more than anything else, for their programs to continue to have high standings. One way to tdo this is to hire your own students. I believe every SW prof (tt or research) at ASU hired in the last 20 years, including the new hire, is an ASU PhD. It all worked out in this case. But what is most important is that any single person applying for a job wants the best for herself or himself and her or his family. For folks outside the loop, it is frustrating and really not entirely "fair." But that is the way jobs work everywhere.</li>
<li>Word.  I know all three of the folks who made the short list, and they all do really good and original work that would tough to compete against even without the important factors you mention for job getting.     </li>
<li>I don't believe this position was filled. All three candidates turned down their offers. Maybe someone with an inside track knows more, though.</li>
<li>Unless something changed drastically in the last couple of days, this position wasn't filled.</li>
</ul></dd></dl>

<p>We seek a broadly trained anthropological archaeologist to join our department, which currently consists of one biological anthropologist and two cultural anthropologists in a department combined with sociology. The new hire will join existing faculty in implementing a newly developed 5-year plan, which emphasizes public engagement and outreach (recruitment) and innovation in curriculum and advising (retention). The preferred candidate will be expected to work toward developing a research program that includes a local field school to train students, who often go on to careers in professional archaeology/CRM. Further, the ideal candidate will have a strong desire to engage with the greater Dayton community to promote the field of archaeology.
</p>
<p>Teaching responsibility is five courses per academic year, including the introductory course in archaeology and upper division courses that include a theory and a methods course. As a small department we cater to a large number of majors within and outside of Anthropology. As such, it is expected that the candidate will develop other courses that are archaeological in topic but will be relevant and appealing to a wider audience, including students from the many departments in the College of Liberal Arts, business, medicine, and natural and physical sciences.
</p>
<p>Wright State is a four-year public university located near Dayton, OH. The Anthropology program, housed in the College of Liberal Arts, serves undergraduate students primarily from the Miami Valley region who come from diverse academic and personal backgrounds including military personnel, first-generation students, and non-traditional students. As such, the ideal candidate will come from a diverse background and have a strong desire to be a part of our academic as well as local community.
</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: Applicants must have a Ph.D. in Anthropology or a closely related field in hand by the time of appointment.
</p>
<ul>
<li>APPLICATIONS: Applicants should submit: 1) a cover letter describing the applicant's research and teaching interests, including a statement that demonstrates potential for implementing a locally-based archaeology program; 2) A curriculum vitae; 3) a list of three persons who can provide reference letters; 4) teaching evaluations; and 5) relevant syllabi from any courses taught.

<p>Things are looking pretty good this yea, eh? Some big names out for the annual tt draft...
</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreed, maybe this is the year of environmental archaeology? That would be great!  </li>
<li>Yeah, environmental archaeology looks great, as long as you work in North America.</li>
<li>Just looked at last year's archive... on Oct 5 2013, there were ~32 jobs listed and 90+ users (78 on the market); Oct 5 2014, I see ~46 jobs, 60 users on the market. Doesn't capture any of the regional/topic trends, but does seem like a better numbers game. </li>
</ul>
<p>For my area, things are looking worse than last year.  Good luck, all!
</p>
<ul><li>Me too, but it is very early days yet. Most of my applications last year went out after the new year. Wishing everyone good luck as well!</li></ul>
<p>One way or another, I'm quitting after this year.  I'm sick of working my butt off as an adjunct for almost no pay.  Good luck to all! (x3)

<p>--There is a generational problem with academics. It is called "baby boomers." They won't go away. Over awarded generation of mediocrity and under-achievement realizing they now have real power in academia, so why retire. Let's, instead, stay employed until we're 80, ruining departments and trying to end the whole system of tenure.
</p>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>--Word.  There's no way many of said underachieving faculty would ever even be considered for an interview in today's market.</li>
<li>-- And the next generation will say the same of those who get jobs in today's market.....</li>
<li>Or, you can look at it this way - baby boomers took a huge hit in the recession and need to keep working to make some $$ back AND keep their affordable health insurance. Just a thought (and no, I am not a baby boomer, but I know this is an issue for many of that generation).</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
<p>It's been a quiet week, so this is a post just for the sake of seeing some update to the page. Apologies for the pointlessness....
</p>
<ul><li>So how improper is it to ask a search committee what your shortcomings were in their eyes?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>I think it depends on how far you made it in the search. If you had some type of interview it would probably be less improper to ask for feedback.</li>
<li>I agree, if you made it to an interview or campus interview stage. I'm not sure how helpful the feedback will be though (my experience was not productive- they just told me I was great and wished I could've been offerred the job, nothing actionable there).  More and more I wonder if the best way for honest feedback is to go the route of The Professor Is In or something along those lines. </li>
<li>The Professor is In (or whatever other academic service) is likely to tell you the same thing. Campus interviews are all about "fit" and it is often that a rejected applicant did absolutely nothing wrong. Just about everyone that makes to the campus interview stage is qualified and worth hiring. Heck, committees these days are routinely phone interviewing a dozen or so people MORE qualified than themselves. For example, if a professor aims to go on sabbatical next fall, a new hire that could cover a course or two is desirable. If you don't have experience with those courses and an equally wonderful applicant does, that can be enough to tip the scale. There is nothing you can do about that. All you can do is try to get as many campus interviews as possible, no easy feat.</li>
<li>You also have to take into consideration that the vast majority of academics are in no way shape or form even remotely qualified to make any serious personnel decisions.</li>
<li>Be careful what you wish for: I once requested feedback and got some off the record.  If I'm being professional, I'd describe the feedback as humbling.  If I'm being honest, I'd describe it as a gut punch.  Just eviscerating.  One critique was that they could smell my desperation ("It was clear you wanted a job, any job.").  So I guess the take away was, act like you're indifferent to the job?  Or enthusiastic without being manic?  Or this was an outlier on the committee?  I mean, I have <i>so</i> many interviews that I can act blase about the position, right? (What font would have told you that last sentence was sarcastic?)  The bottom line is that regardless of how many more publications you have, how many classes you've taught, and how groundbreaking your student-friendly fieldwork is, each hiring committee is different.  They have the pick of the litter right now (perhaps because they are churning out so many Ph.D.s?), so they can be incredibly choosey beyond the basic pubs., classes, and fieldwork checklist.  I am pretty sure I once got a job because I grew up in an area with a large Native American minority population and that matched their student body, plus I could teach a really random class they wanted.  I've got friends who have jobs they hate because they ended up not being the right fit for the department, university, or region, but they don't want to complain because they have a job.  I've given up getting upset about this.  After 100 applications over a number of years, I think I've become numb to rejection. As for the professor is in, I've heard positive reviews from people who used the services early on in their search but negative reviews from people who had been at it for a while.</li>

<p><b>Re: Above. Fine. Lets start a different list. Running list of universities to whom AAA is irrelevant and who aren't violating anything, but of whom we nonetheless disapprove because they find it appropriate to unnessarily burden letter writers and do not care about the strain placed on relationships between job seekers and their colleagues.</b>
</p>
<p>In case you can't tell the difference, Canada is actually a different country than the United States.  Kind of like Australia or England (which are not states either).  And it has a very different job market than that of the United States.  If you don't like it than don't apply for this poorly paid part-time probationary position that was only listed on one Canadian job site (as far as I could tell), which suggests to me that there is an internal candidate anyhow.  There are plenty of universities to disapprove of because they have unfair labour practices rather than irritating hiring practices.  Besides which, what does this list actually even do.  The universities are still going to follow their own protocal and people are still going to apply to them because we are all either desperate or will be in a couple years.  How about a list of schools that have unfair labour practices, that treat their employees like robots, or that fill their teaching staff by hiring one-year visiting professor positions.  Why not?  Because it doesn't affect anything or anyone, it just makes a couple people feel slightly better.
</p>
<p>Your assumption that I am American is baseless. I am not. Regardless of my nationality, or yours, requiring letters from all applicants is unreasonble.
</p>
<dl>
<dd>- While not implying they are the same, I also don't think Canada is a "very" different job market. I can think of several Canadian colleagues who have applied to USA jobs and vice versa. I consider my Canadian colleagues as part of the same academic network as me, and we attend the same conferences. But that could just be my experience. Just as you stated that we need not apply if we don't agree with Canadian universities' hiring processes, you also do not need to check this wiki page if you don't agree with the general sentiments. And sure, this list may not do much, but no action is not that much better.</dd>
<dd>- I think the point about the difference is a numbers game: much less applicants applying for jobs for Canadian posts and less jobs posted = less letters that need to be written, not there isn't similarity or communication between the two countries. (But, I would agree that there should never be a reason to request a letter of reference unless you are seriously considering hiring someone. A CV should be enough to begin the process.)  </dd>
<dd>- Yes, that's what I meant, thanks.  And I did not say that I thought you were a US citizen.  I also agree that Canadian universities should get in the game and stop asking for references upfront.  I think that it is extremely inconsiderate and it pisses me off when I have to ask people to write me references for yet another job and I have zero chance of even being considered for.  That being said, considering the number of people accessing this site, I think it is verging on slanderous to accuse a university of violating some set of rules that they are not even beholden to.</dd>
<dd>- Speaking of slander, on two occasions I have had to remove names of institutions from this list, because when I went and read the application, they had not requested letters upfront.....</dd>
<dd>- It is a terrible practice for any university to have, regardless of country or faculty/department. It's not standard for Canadian universities to request reference letters upfront. Most that I've encountered do NOT request them until later, usually after a long-list has been established. I believe that the AAA was morally right for requesting that unversities stop this practice. I don't think that they were directing this recommendation specifically to American instutions but to all instittuions in general. Most universities have no affiliation with the AAA anyway. It's not a government run group that has any say in official regulations. In response to whether this list has any purpose, I would say that it DOES. It names-and-shames those who are continuing this practice. It keeps a record of this as well so that we can easily see over the past few years which universities have reformed and which have basically said, "Too bad." Since it has been connected to the AAA request that this procedure stop, it may also put pressure on members of hiring committees since many of them (including in Canada) are members of the AAA. If someone would like to start ANOTHER list of universities that do something else which is unethical, I would gladly support that as well.</dd>
<dd>- It is also worth saying that this wiki is used by people who are hoping for academic positions. One rather hopes that when we achieve such a position we will use our new found power and influence to treat the next generation of job seekers with more consideration and compassion than we have been shown.</dd>

<p>It is completely inappropriate to add MacEwan to this list since they did not advertise the position on the AAA website.  Believe it or not, it is completely standard for Canadian universities to request references upfront.  So, even though it sucks, MacEwan isn't violating anything and should me removed.  Which is why I erased it and left this explanation instead.
</p>
<dl>
<dd>-It is not standard for Canadian universities. The AAA request was to universities in general, not necessarily ones advertising on their website nor specifically to American universities. Just because no Canadian, UK, Australian or other associatoin made such a statement, I have a hard time believing that academic job searchers of any country would find this practice to be justified. </dd>
<dd>-Well, if it is not standard, it is exceptionally common.  I have applied for almost every Canadian position offered in the past three years and only two or maybe three (out of about 10) did not ask for letters upfront. And I don't think anyone on this listserv has given any indication that they support the practice.  We all know that it is a waste of everyone's time and collegial resources.  </dd>

<ul>
<li>Am I missing something? I applied to McGill and they only ask for names of refs. Letters arent required.</li>
<li>Ditto, their job ad says "contact information for three referees"</li>
<li>I provided contact information, and my references were immediately contacted by the application system. (x3)</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>Oh GOD This is SO Boring. Please Kill Me, OK. My refs didnt say anything about it. That is kind of lame to do without warning.</li>
<li>On their system there is a button to send our reference request - it only gets sent out if you chose to send the reference request. Has anybody contacted them to see if they actually want the letters upfront?</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>
<ul><li>From McGill's AcademicJobsOnline profile for this job: "Three References (actual letters acceptable but not required, just names and email addresses)"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>It must have been a glitch in the system.  When I applied there was a button that I could check if I wanted to request reference letters.  I did not click the button and they were not contacted.  Hey, at least the letters are there now and one less thing to worry about!... And no, they do not want letters upfront - it is plainly stated in both the job advertisement and the online application.  It is reassuring that some Canadian university faculty are now hip enough to the US market to realize that asking for references upfront is not cool.  The Canadian job market is much slower and smaller and asking for references upfront is not as much of a burden on advisors and colleagues as it is here in the US.</li></ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>FYI, I didn't apply to McGill, but am having a similar situation with some other schools. It seems to be a function that's built in to a lot of the application portals many schools are using. I'm not sure if committees know this is happening or not, and I'm not sure what the point of "burying" this requirement is. I assume someone could disable it. (Also, I just saw the note above about the button to send reference requests, and I've encountered that too - and have been asked to request references at a school that did not ask for references up front, but I have no indication that I'm on a long list now.)</li>
<li>If you didn't want your referees to be contacted you needed to to not agree to them to be contacted when using the online system. Always look at a webpage to see what is being requested....</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>I'm not sure aboutt he McGill application, but there is no option to provide contact information for references but ask that they not be contacted for the application systems I've used. In fact, if you do not enter at least three references and their full contact information, your application is marked "incomplete" and you cannot submit it. There is no "these are my references, but please don't contact them" button. And, of course, I <i>do</i> want them to be contacted, but not for letters at the beginning stage of the application. There are a number of reasons AAA asked for that not to happen. (But perhaps you're referencing an idiosyncrasy of the McGill system that, again, I did not see - because I did not apply. I was just trying to contribute to the broader discussion.)</li>
<li>The McGill application used the services of academicjobsonline.org - with that system you enter the referee details and if you want them to be notified when you submit, you have to check a box. The default is for them not to be notified. You therefore have control over whether they are notified when you submit.</li>
<li>That sounds like a better system than I've seen elsewhere. (A little silly, maybe, since hopefully they know you're applying to that job anyway, but at least there's an option for notification/no notification.)</li>
<li>The NYU application was the same -- same system I think. If I had to hazard a guess, the vendor just edited the content of a student application system and re-deployed it.</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>"I took the possibly daring step of contacting their office and asking" - if you are talking about McGill, there was no problem! The system didn't send out a referee request, and there is a warning on the system that says: "DO NOT check the "email notify writer on submit" or "email again" boxes below if you don't need to request your reference writers for letters now." As stated above, the default for the system McGill used was for the notify boxes to be unchecked.</li>
<li>" I took the possibly daring step of contacting their office and asking" can you clarify which office? McGill or NYU? Thanks!</li>
<li>McGill. Glad there was no problem.</li>
<li>"McGill. Glad there was no problem." - but had you contacted them and had told them there was a problem? Seems a bit hasty....</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>"Seems a bit hasty...." Oh, come on, no one really cares if you contact the office and ask about stuff like that.  It's not like they blacklist people for making inquiries.  Let's not start making each other paranoid for no reason. </li>
<li>Not trying to make anyone paranoid!! Just noting that it seems hasty to report errors where there were none. Why make some IT person search for phantom errors!</li>
<li>I sent the email early in this discussion, when the only information was "I provided contact information, and my references were immediately contacted by the application system. (x3)"  I did not complete the application myself since I was worried about my references being immediately contacted, so I did not know what the issue was or that there was a box to check. So I was not "reporting an error," but asking "why have three people had their references immediately contacted? Is this an error?" Cheers and best of luck to everyone.</li>
<li>OK. Good to have that clarified. But I guess it isn't clear what you mean when you say that you didn't apply for the job because of a worry that referees would be contacted. The application system makes it very clear that they won't be notified unless you go out of your way to check the boxes. Anyhow, best of luck to you and all in job searching and website navigating!</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>
<ul><li>One thing I'm confused about: was this a situation where everyone applied had their references contacted, or was this a "long listing" situation where there was an initial cut before interviews? I thought it was the latter, but based on what people have said here, maybe its the former?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul>
<li>This arose when people first applied using the online system - their references were not contacted, it was just a warning on the system.</li>
<li>Can you clarify that?  Were the people contacted today on a "long list" but they had previously not submitted reference letters? Or the people contacted today were not long listed but letters were requested to have a level playing field for all applicants?</li>
<li>I can't clarify about what happened with those contacted today, but I can clarify that all applicants who used the online system to apply weeks ago (as far back as Nov.) <b>did not </b>submit reference letters at the time of their application. The applicants were never asked for reference letters when applying, just the names of referees.</li>
